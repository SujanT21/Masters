      "Results collected: [{'Document Name': '01.txt', 'Original Text': \"Suryakumar Yadav snatched a boundary catch for the ages, Jasprit Bumrah snuck in two electric final overs, and Hardik Pandya pilfered the two big wickets as India pulled off one of their great heists to win a World Cup, finally.\\n\\nWith five overs to go, South Africa were rampant. Heinrich Klaasen, one of the great hitters in the game, threatening to throw off decades of painful big-match history for his team with a hail of sixes. He and David Miller had clubbed 38 runs off the two previous overs, and with six wickets in hand South Africa needed only a run-a-ball off the last 30 balls.\\n\\nRohit Sharma was forced to go to the best bowler in the world, when he would have otherwise saved Bumrah for later overs. Bumrah didn't quite break the partnership, the batters never daring to take him on. But he did break Klaasen and Miller's stride. They scrambled only four runs off that over.\\n\\nBut the most telling blow, came at the start of the 17th over. After the flow of the game was further slowed due to an apparent knee complaint for Rishabh Pant, Hardik bowled a wide line outside off and took the edge of Klaasen, Pant snaffling the chance gleefully.\\n\\nStill, Miller was there, though he couldn't get a boundary away off the rest of that over.\\n\\nThen Bumrah came back, bowled several ripsnorters in the last over of yet another tournament he has dominated. With one of those magic balls, a wicked in-seamer, he burst through the defenses of the last recognised South Africa batter, Marco Jansen, and grazed leg stump.\\n\\nWith Keshav Maharaj now in the middle, their batting line-up notably short, and 20 needed off 12 balls, South Africa were for the first time since the early overs of the chase in trouble. Arshdeep Singh delivered a nerveless 19th over, off which South Africa could muster only four.\\n\\nThe dream-killing blow came next. With 16 needed off the final over, bowled by Hardik. Miller tried to lift the first ball, a wide full toss, over the straight boundary. But he didn't connect perfectly, and Suryakumar, running full tilt along the rope, his feet only centimetres inside, caught the ball, popped it up as he briefly stepped over the boundary, then completed the running catch as he hopped back into the field, sparking wild jubilation in the stands, and ecstatic celebrations from the India players.\\n\\nSouth Africa batters No. 8, 9, and 10, did not manage to get Hardik away, aside from a single outside edge that flew for four.\\n\\nWhen Hardik India completed the seven-run win, the bowler sank to his knees in relief, his team-mates exulted, and the crowd, largely supporting India, flew into euphoria. Their team had become World Champions again, after 13 years.\\n\\nBumrah's spectacular finals showing\\n\\nOn a flat track in Barbados, Bumrah bowled two unplayable deliveries that brought him two wickets - both bowled. The first of these was the better one. It was one of the best in the tournament, and very arguably one of the best ever in finals. Angled in to Reeza Hendricks, it pitched and seamed away to hit the top of off, beating the batter's outside edge.\\n\\nHe conceded five runs in that first over, eight runs in the next (one of only two boundaries off his bowling came here - a not fully-controlled steer through deep third).\\n\\nBut those last two overs went some distance to defining this match. Four runs off the 16th over, after the 15th had been clubbed for 24 runs. Two runs off the 17th. His figures were 2 for 18.\\n\\nArshdeep plays his role\\n\\nArshdeep Singh was almost as outstanding, returning 2 for 20. His two powerplay overs cost only eight, and brought the important wicket of Aiden Markram, who edged him behind. In the middle overs, he dismissed Quinton de Kock, who was looking to raise the tempo after he had overseen the recover after two early blows.\\n\\nAnd then that fantastic 19th over, in which he bowled two balls to Miller but conceded only three off them, otherwise keeping Maharaj on strike.\\n\\nThis, after India's spinners had leaked 106 off their nine collective overs.\\n\\nKlaasen makes a six-filled charge\\n\\nOne of the best hits of the tournament was Klaasen crashing a wide, Kuldeep Yadav googly way over the cover boundary for six, with minimal foot movement. That was his third six (he'd banged Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja over the rope earlier).\\n\\nBut it was against Axar Patel that he really thumped South Africa into the ascendancy. First ball of the 15th over, he bullied down the ground off the back foot for four. Axar bowled two wides in fear. Then later, two massive hits down the ground - one of which pounded the roof of the stadium, then a four through wide long-off for good measure.\\n\\nHe completed his fifty off 23 balls, the fastest ever in a T20 World Cup final. After he was dismissed, South Africa could not manage a single intentional boundary, the only four coming off Kagiso Rabada's outside edge.\\n\\nKohli drops anchor\\n\\nThe headlines will say Virat Kohli top scored with 76 off 59, but there were times when this knock was laboured.\\n\\nBetween the fourth and 18th over, Kohli faced 35 balls in which he scored 29 and hit no boundaries. When he got to fifty, he had used up 48 deliveries, and didn't raise his bat, having batted for most of that time in ODI middle-overs mode. There was an obvious critique to make here: was this an innings so unambitious, it was actually doing India harm?\\n\\nBut the counter-argument is strong. Kohli had been 22 off 16 when the third wicket (Suryakumar Yadav) went down, in the fifth over. And the security he gave at one end, allowed Axar (pushed up the order No. 5) and Shivam Dube to prosper with their big-hitting.\\n\\nHis stands with those batters reaped 72 off 54 (Axar hit 47 off 31) and 57 off 33 (Dube hit 22 off 13), and formed the heft of India's innings. Their 176 for 7 was the most any team has scored in a World Cup final.\\n\\nDid South Africa choke?\\n\\nFor 35 overs of this game, you could not have possibly arrived at that conclusion. They were pumped up in the early overs, when Keshav Maharaj struck twice, and Rabada removed Suryakumar - India's most-dangerous batter. They held their catches and were excellent in the outfield.\\n\\nThey overcame losing early wickets nicely too. But at one point, they needed 26 off 24 balls, had six wickets in hand, and only one over of Bumrah left to face. They tried to target Hardik, which was the smart play in that situation, but lost both their key batters to him.\\n\\nThere are simpler explanations too: India were battle-hardened and skilful; South Africa's batting line-up was short.\", 'Reference Summary': 'Bumrah and Hardik script stunning comeback to lead India to T20 World Cup glory.

It's been 11 years since they stood on the podium as champions. Now all that separates them from glory is a few hours' time and a fiery South African team.\\n\\nRohit Sharma and his men dismantled the defending champions England in the T20 World Cup 2024 semi-final, bowling them out for a mere 103 after first whacking them around to make 171 in Providence, Guyana. The mismatch from Adelaide 2022 was turned on its head.\\n\\nTactical battle in tough conditions\\n\\nOn a pitch like Guyana's - where the pace was slow and the bounce was low - runs square and behind the wicket come at a premium. That's because if a bowling unit is disciplined enough to hit a good length and keep the stumps in play, the batter just cannot force the pace. England planned to shut out half of the outfield to India but they weren't always successful: 69 runs, including eight fours and three sixes, still came from where they shouldn't have, at a strike rate of 192.\\n\\nRohit and risk\\n\\nWithin the powerplay period, Rohit was scoring at a strike rate of 133 with shots he was not at all in control of. For context, his overall career strike rate in T20Is is 141. This has been the difference India have been searching for. Don't just bat waiting for the bad ball. Bat as if everything is a bad ball.\\n\\nRohit eventually settled. Since the fourth over, he was in control of 20 of 26 balls and he used that control to great effect, scoring 40 runs including four fours and two sixes. He's accepted that risk is a part of T20 cricket and there's no point being averse to it.\\n\\nThe Rashid recovery\\n\\nIndia's intent manifested in the form of their batters moving around in the crease. Even a bowler of the calibre of Adil Rashid found it hard to cope and that was a triumph because these were conditions where as a bowler all you had to do was hit a length to target the top of the stumps. The England wristspinner was 2-0-17-0. But he recovered. On the other side of the second rain break, which consumed 153 minutes of this game's time in total, Rashid decided not to worry about where Rohit and Suryakumar were positioning themselves and instead began to hold a line on off stump. His reward was the wicket of the India captain for 57 off 39. Rashid's final two overs went for only eight runs.\\n\\nSpin is king\\n\\nWith Rashid done by the 14th over, India held Shivam Dube back believing that the quicks would be taking over. So Buttler found reason to press Liam Livingstone to work, trusting his right-arm all-sorts even at the death. The part-timer finished with figures of 4-0-24-0. It was sign. If he was proving to be unhittable, Axar, Kuldeep and Ravindra Jadeja would be as well. India's spin-bowling allrounders had a hand to play in getting them to 171 as well, alongside Hardik Pandya, as they struck three sixes and two fours in the last two overs bowled by Jordan and Archer.\\n\\nBox office Axar\\n\\nGuyana is spin-friendly. The schedule, as soon as it was announced, suggested India would play there in the semi-final. They packed their squad with spinners. Three of them found place in the XI. Each of them took turns bowling jaffas.\\n\\nAxar was the game-changer. He came on immediately after Jos Buttler had whacked Arshdeep Singh for three fours in an over and with his very first ball took out the biggest threat. England's captain went down to reverse-sweep the left-arm spinner because really in these conditions you couldn't just sit in and play straight-bat shots. Rohit found the boundary when he took that gamble earlier. Buttler only found a toe-end to Pant.\\n\\nEach of Axar's first three overs had a wicket off the first ball. Jonny Bairstow once again choosing to stay leg side and getting bowled, and Moeen Ali's England career potentially ending with him unsure of where the ball had gone only to realise it was right there in Pant's hand as he broke the stumps.\\n\\nKuldeep's redemption\\n\\nEngland were 49 for 4 when Kuldeep got into the act, bamboozling Sam Curran, and then outsmarting Harry Brook. England were the team that took him down so hard he went off into white-ball wilderness after the 2019 ODI World Cup. Here, against a batter coming after him, and with unconventional shots to boot, he didn't panic. Kuldeep saw Brook going down to reverse-sweep, so he shifted the line onto leg stump, and left him in a tangle, the flatter trajectory and the quicker pace also playing a part in ball evading the swing of the bat and crashing into the stumps behind.\\n\\nAs further sign of their impending defeat, England's last recognised batter, Livingstone, was run-out after a mix-up with the lower order. The defending champions yielded their crown, with six of them making single-digit scores and none of them going past 25.\", 'Reference Summary': \"Rohit, Axar and Kuldeep lead India's dismantling of England in semi-final.

South Africa left next to nothing to chance. They bowled beautifully, fielded well, and weathered some difficult early overs while pouncing on the loose balls.\\n\\nAs their reward, they have their first ever berth in a men's World Cup final, and continued their unbeaten run in the tournament, which now is up to eight matches. The margin of victory, by nine wickets and with 67 balls remaining, underscored the control they exerted on this match, from start to finish.\\n\\nJansen and Rabada rip out the top order\\n\\nThe Tarouba surface not only offered lateral movement but also a lot of bounce early on. With the heights that Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada bring to the table, South Africa had a great attack to exploit conditions.\\n\\nJansen struck at the end of the first over to remove Afghanistan's batter of the tournament - Rahmanullah Gurbaz - who edged a ball angled across him to Hendricks at slip. In his next over, Jansen bowled Gulbadin Naib through the gate with a delivery that darted back into him.\\n\\nRabada's first over sent Afghanistan really into a nosedive. He jagged two balls back and hit timber on both occasions. The ball that clipped the top of Ibrahim Zadran's middle stump was the killer - Ibrahim at that point was Afghanistan's best hope of getting to a good score. Fourth ball, he took out Mohammad Nabi's off stump with an even more stunning delivery. That over was a double-wicket maiden.\\n\\nNortje and Shamsi do the rest\\n\\nWith the top five gone, and their middle order having failed to produce much right through the tournament, Afghanistan were seriously struggling. Anrich Nortje and Tabraiz Shamsi closed down the innings from there. Nortje had Azmatullah Omarzai (the only Afghan batter to get to double figures) caught at deep point, then later knocked out Rashid Khan's off stump.\\n\\nShamsi bowled a leg-stump line to the right-handers and kept getting them lbw as the balls rushed onto them. They reviewed all three decisions, but the on-field umpires had given them out, and umpires' calls on impact were good enough.\\n\\nFarooqi and Naveen can't wreck South Africa's top order\\n\\nComing into this match, Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq had 29 wickets between them. Their only chance of defending such a paltry score was running through the top order together.\\n\\nFarooqi added to his tournament-high wicket tally in his first over, setting de Kock up with some big outswingers before jagging one back in and making a mess of his stumps.\\n\\nAnd Naveen should have had Markram the next over, but most of Afghanistan's players didn't hear the thin edge to the wicketkeeper, and Rashid wasn't sure enough of it to review the decision.\\n\\nMarkram and Hendricks take the chase home\\n\\nThere were still testing moments, as the pitch continued to play up, still often keeping low. But whenever Afghanistan bowled poor deliveries, South Africa's batters pounced. The fifth over itself yielded 13 runs - more than a fifth of the target. South Africa got home in the ninth over, sparking restrained celebrations, even though this was a historic victory for them.\", 'Reference Summary': \"South Africa demolish Afghanistan to enter their maiden men's World Cup final.
