01.txt,Suryakumar Yadav snatched a boundary catch for the ages  Jasprit Bumrah snuck in two electric final overs  and Hardik Pandya pilfered the two big wickets as India pulled off one of their great heists to win a World Cup  finally  With five overs to go  South Africa were rampant  Heinrich Klaasen  one of the great hitters in the game  threatening to throw off decades of painful big match history for his team with a hail of sixes  He and David Miller had clubbed 38 runs off the two previous overs  and with six wickets in hand South Africa needed only a run a ball off the last 30 balls  Rohit Sharma was forced to go to the best bowler in the world  when he would have otherwise saved Bumrah for later overs  Bumrah didn t quite break the partnership  the batters never daring to take him on  But he did break Klaasen and Miller s stride  They scrambled only four runs off that over  But the most telling blow  came at the start of the 17th over  After the flow of the game was further slowed due to an apparent knee complaint for Rishabh Pant  Hardik bowled a wide line outside off and took the edge of Klaasen  Pant snaffling the chance gleefully  Still  Miller was there  though he couldn t get a boundary away off the rest of that over  Then Bumrah came back  bowled several ripsnorters in the last over of yet another tournament he has dominated  With one of those magic balls  a wicked in seamer  he burst through the defenses of the last recognised South Africa batter  Marco Jansen  and grazed leg stump  With Keshav Maharaj now in the middle  their batting line up notably short  and 20 needed off 12 balls  South Africa were for the first time since the early overs of the chase in trouble  Arshdeep Singh delivered a nerveless 19th over  off which South Africa could muster only four  The dream killing blow came next  With 16 needed off the final over  bowled by Hardik  Miller tried to lift the first ball  a wide full toss  over the straight boundary  But he didn t connect perfectly  and Suryakumar  running full tilt along the rope  his feet only centimetres inside  caught the ball  popped it up as he briefly stepped over the boundary  then completed the running catch as he hopped back into the field  sparking wild jubilation in the stands  and ecstatic celebrations from the India players  South Africa batters No  8  9  and 10  did not manage to get Hardik away  aside from a single outside edge that flew for four  When Hardik India completed the seven run win  the bowler sank to his knees in relief  his team mates exulted  and the crowd  largely supporting India  flew into euphoria  Their team had become World Champions again  after 13 years  Bumrah s spectacular finals showing On a flat track in Barbados  Bumrah bowled two unplayable deliveries that brought him two wickets   both bowled  The first of these was the better one  It was one of the best in the tournament  and very arguably one of the best ever in finals  Angled in to Reeza Hendricks  it pitched and seamed away to hit the top of off  beating the batter s outside edge  He conceded five runs in that first over  eight runs in the next  one of only two boundaries off his bowling came here   a not fully controlled steer through deep third   But those last two overs went some distance to defining this match  Four runs off the 16th over  after the 15th had been clubbed for 24 runs  Two runs off the 17th  His figures were 2 for 18  Arshdeep plays his role Arshdeep Singh was almost as outstanding  returning 2 for 20  His two powerplay overs cost only eight  and brought the important wicket of Aiden Markram  who edged him behind  In the middle overs  he dismissed Quinton de Kock  who was looking to raise the tempo after he had overseen the recover after two early blows  And then that fantastic 19th over  in which he bowled two balls to Miller but conceded only three off them  otherwise keeping Maharaj on strike  This  after India s spinners had leaked 106 off their nine collective overs  Klaasen makes a six filled charge One of the best hits of the tournament was Klaasen crashing a wide  Kuldeep Yadav googly way over the cover boundary for six  with minimal foot movement  That was his third six  he d banged Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja over the rope earlier   But it was against Axar Patel that he really thumped South Africa into the ascendancy  First ball of the 15th over  he bullied down the ground off the back foot for four  Axar bowled two wides in fear  Then later  two massive hits down the ground   one of which pounded the roof of the stadium  then a four through wide long off for good measure  He completed his fifty off 23 balls  the fastest ever in a T20 World Cup final  After he was dismissed  South Africa could not manage a single intentional boundary  the only four coming off Kagiso Rabada s outside edge  Kohli drops anchor The headlines will say Virat Kohli top scored with 76 off 59  but there were times when this knock was laboured  Between the fourth and 18th over  Kohli faced 35 balls in which he scored 29 and hit no boundaries  When he got to fifty  he had used up 48 deliveries  and didn t raise his bat  having batted for most of that time in ODI middle overs mode  There was an obvious critique to make here  was this an innings so unambitious  it was actually doing India harm  But the counter argument is strong  Kohli had been 22 off 16 when the third wicket  Suryakumar Yadav  went down  in the fifth over  And the security he gave at one end  allowed Axar  pushed up the order No  5  and Shivam Dube to prosper with their big hitting  His stands with those batters reaped 72 off 54  Axar hit 47 off 31  and 57 off 33  Dube hit 22 off 13   and formed the heft of India s innings  Their 176 for 7 was the most any team has scored in a World Cup final  Did South Africa choke  For 35 overs of this game  you could not have possibly arrived at that conclusion  They were pumped up in the early overs  when Keshav Maharaj struck twice  and Rabada removed Suryakumar   India s most dangerous batter  They held their catches and were excellent in the outfield  They overcame losing early wickets nicely too  But at one point  they needed 26 off 24 balls  had six wickets in hand  and only one over of Bumrah left to face  They tried to target Hardik  which was the smart play in that situation  but lost both their key batters to him  There are simpler explanations too  India were battle hardened and skilful  South Africa s batting line up was short ,Bumrah and Hardik script stunning comeback

02.txt,India s quest for a world title is well on course  It s been 11 years since they stood on the podium as champions  Now all that separates them from glory is a few hours  time and a fiery South African team  Rohit Sharma and his men dismantled the defending champions England in the T20 World Cup 2024 semi final  bowling them out for a mere 103 after first whacking them around to make 171 in Providence  Guyana  The mismatch from Adelaide 2022 was turned on its head  Tactical battle in tough conditions On a pitch like Guyana s   where the pace was slow and the bounce was low   runs square and behind the wicket come at a premium  That s because if a bowling unit is disciplined enough to hit a good length and keep the stumps in play  the batter just cannot force the pace  England planned to shut out half of the outfield to India but they weren t always successful  69 runs  including eight fours and three sixes  still came from where they shouldn t have  at a strike rate of 192  Rohit and risk Within the powerplay period  Rohit was scoring at a strike rate of 133 with shots he was not at all in control of  For context  his overall career strike rate in T20Is is 141  This has been the difference India have been searching for  Don t just bat waiting for the bad ball  Bat as if everything is a bad ball  Rohit eventually settled  Since the fourth over  he was in control of 20 of 26 balls and he used that control to great effect  scoring 40 runs including four fours and two sixes  He s accepted that risk is a part of T20 cricket and there s no point being averse to it  The Rashid recovery India s intent manifested in the form of their batters moving around in the crease  Even a bowler of the calibre of Adil Rashid found it hard to cope and that was a triumph because these were conditions where as a bowler all you had to do was hit a length to target the top of the stumps  The England wristspinner was 2 0 17 0  But he recovered  On the other side of the second rain break  which consumed 153 minutes of this game s time in total  Rashid decided not to worry about where Rohit and Suryakumar were positioning themselves and instead began to hold a line on off stump  His reward was the wicket of the India captain for 57 off 39  Rashid s final two overs went for only eight runs  Spin is king With Rashid done by the 14th over  India held Shivam Dube back believing that the quicks would be taking over  So Buttler found reason to press Liam Livingstone to work  trusting his right arm all sorts even at the death  The part timer finished with figures of 4 0 24 0  It was sign  If he was proving to be unhittable  Axar  Kuldeep and Ravindra Jadeja would be as well  India s spin bowling allrounders had a hand to play in getting them to 171 as well  alongside Hardik Pandya  as they struck three sixes and two fours in the last two overs bowled by Jordan and Archer  Box office Axar Guyana is spin friendly  The schedule  as soon as it was announced

came on immediately after Jos Buttler had whacked Arshdeep Singh for three fours in an over and with his very first ball took out the biggest threat  England s captain went down to reverse sweep the left arm spinner because really in these conditions you couldn t just sit in and play straight bat shots  Rohit found the boundary when he took that gamble earlier  Buttler only found a toe end to Pant  Each of Axar s first three overs had a wicket off the first ball  Jonny Bairstow once again choosing to stay leg side and getting bowled  and Moeen Ali s England career potentially ending with him unsure of where the ball had gone only to realise it was right there in Pant s hand as he broke the stumps  Kuldeep s redemption England were 49 for 4 when Kuldeep got into the act  bamboozling Sam Curran  and then outsmarting Harry Brook  England were the team that took him down so hard he went off into white ball wilderness after the 2019 ODI World Cup  Here  against a batter coming after him  and with unconventional shots to boot  he didn t panic  Kuldeep saw Brook going down to reverse sweep  so he shifted the line onto leg stump  and left him in a tangle  the flatter trajectory and the quicker pace also playing a part in ball evading the swing of the bat and crashing into the stumps behind  As further sign of their impending defeat  England s last recognised batter  Livingstone  was run out after a mix up with the lower order  The defending champions yielded their crown  with six of them making single digit scores and none of them going past 25 ,Rohit  Axar and Kuldeep lead

his next over  Jansen bowled Gulbadin Naib through the gate with a delivery that darted back into him  Rabada s first over sent Afghanistan really into a nosedive  He jagged two balls back and hit

the chase  Mohammad Nabi had a constant smile on his face  Dwayne Bravo wasn t able to watch it  But the one moment that encapsulated the emotionally charged night in Kingstown was Naveen ul Haq taking off after taking the final Bangladesh wicket  That sealed Afghanistan s maiden spot in the semi final of any men s senior World Cup  In a match that had a start stop nature owing to multiple rain interventions  Afghanistan   led by four fors from Naveen and Rashid   edged out Bangladesh by a mere eight runs  and in the process  also knocked Australia out of the T20 World Cup 2024  Both teams  along with Australia  were in contention for one semi final spot from Group 1 of Super Eight  and the rain only added to the drama  For the best part of the last hour  a cat and mouse game ensued  There were moments when Bangladesh edged Afghanistan out on the DLS par score  only for the latter to come back to snatch back the advantage by picking up wickets  Litton Das  with a best of 36 before Monday in the tournament  stayed through it all  but couldn t take Bangladesh over the line  Rashid and Co  danced their hearts out after knocking two teams with a single blow  and the

to the semi final  Their chase was delayed by half an hour  thanks to a 20 minute downpour  A shorter game  therefore  was disadvantageous to Bangladesh  After the second rain break  though  Bangladesh sent out mixed signals  Litton attacked Naveen but Soumya Sarkar fell in a bid to do so against Rashid  Towhid Hridoy s risks against Mohammad Nabi  which included a dropped catch  came off but he  too  holed out off Rashid  But with Litton hitting Rashid for successive fours   first over mid off and then just past slip   Bangladesh looked on track to hunt the target down to qualify  But soon  Mahmudullah s indecisiveness and Rishad Hossain s adventurousness meant they slipped to 80 for 7 after 11 overs  Which is when the rainy clouds returned to continuously hover around the stadium  and constantly brought the DLS par scores into picture for the rest of the night  In the face of increasing pressure  Litton seemingly kept his calm  He has had a forgettable 2024 in T20Is  striking at under 100 and his place in the Bangladesh set up under scanner  But he started off with intent and kept up their hopes of signing off from the T20 World Cup with a win  But it was not meant to be

his second over  But with a deep midwicket in place  Naveen once again bowled a length ball angling into Shanto  who picked out the fielder there  Naveen then got the next ball to straighten just enough to catch Shakib Al Hasan s leading edge for a return catch and Bangladesh were 23 for 3  Afghanistan steady but slow One of the methods that has worked for Afghanistan  and their openers  in this World Cup is a non enterprising start  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran stayed true to form  taking very few chances inside the powerplay as well as in the first ten overs  They finished the powerplay on 27 for 0 and at the ten over mark were 58 for 0  It was Gurbaz and Ibrahim s fourth fifty partnership  the most by any pair in a T20 World Cup  In the first ten overs  there were only 15 attempts of attacking shots  that too on a surface that was slowing down and was going to see dew later on  Rishad leads Bangladesh squeeze When Rishad was brought on in the ninth over  the wind was blowing diagonally from right to left  in the direction of his natural spin  He immediately beat Ibrahim s outside edge  and in his second over used the bounce on offer to get the same batter s leading edge caught at long off  Gurbaz then took the attack to Rishad in his third over  He first slapped one over cover point to end a phase of 38 legal balls without a four  and then used the sweep for another four through backward square leg region  However  Rishad had the last laugh when he had Gurbaz holing out to deep cover in his last over  A couple of balls later  he also had Gulbadin Naib miscue a slice towards cover point  Naib could have gotten away if not for Sarkar  who sprinted in from the deep and dived forward almost near the 30 metre circle  And just like that  Afghanistan had

 and finished on 19 not out  He struck three sixes  two of those in the last over bowled by Tanzim Hasan Sakib  He used good use of the willow generally  except on one occasion when he flung it towards his partner  Karim Janat  It was the last over of the innings and Rashid wanted a second run to retain strike but Janat refused it  Still  he helped Afghanistan score 22 in the last 14 balls

06.txt,Now  they ve  almost  done it all  After an undefeated streak of six matches  five of them far too close for comfort  South Africa have survived a rain reduced match and successfully chased a tricky target to book the spot in the semi final of the men s T20 World Cup 2024  They knocked co hosts West Indies out in the process and have topped their Super Eight group  which means they are also likely to avoid India in the final four  We ll say it again  is this their time  All the evidence points to a change of fortunes for a team that has so long coveted an ICC trophy and equally long  been denied  South Africa are now winning games they should be losing  scrapping like their rugby counterparts  the Springboks   who won the quarterfinals  semifinals and final  each by one point last year   and finding ways to overcome pressure  There s a new found tenacity to them and it s seen them get to a T20 World Cup knockout for the first time in a decade  Incidentally  when they got to the final four in the 2014 tournament  Aiden Markram had just led the Under 19 team to the World Cup  Now  he finds himself captaining the senior side and he is doing differently and to great success  Markram took the new ball in this match  and bowled himself for a full quota of four overs  He decided to rely on a non traditional strength  spin  South Africa had never bowled this many overs of spin in a T20 World Cup match  and only bowled more twice before against Sri Lanka in 2021  and the change of tack worked a charm  Between them  South Africa s spinners took 5 for 79 in 12 overs  They were largely responsible for keeping West Indies quiet and for several of the 57 dot balls West Indies faced in their innings   the equivalent of 9 3 overs   and the most at this T20 World Cup  Only an 81 run stand between Kyle Mayers and Roston Chase kept West Indies in the game  and they were the only two batters to get an individual score of more than 15  And once the tears have dried  West Indies will look to their batting as the major reason they were unable to advance  Their bowlers worked with what they had and had South Africa 15 for 2 in two overs  before the rain came down  They kept at and removed all the recognised batters  Chase s 3 for 12 and Joseph s 2 for 25 meant South Africa were always on tenterhooks but at seven down  Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen took it home  Markram gets funky but fielding gets messy An eventful first 10 overs saw South Africa drop four catches and Markram become just the second South Africa spinner to bowl four successive overs after opening the bowling in a men s T20I  and that was with two specialist spinners in the XI  Markram shared the new ball with Jansen  and got a wicket with his first ball  as South Africa won the early exchanges with West Indies 5 for 2 early on  They should have had a third in Jansen s next over  when Chase  on 12  swiped across the line and hit it straight up  Anrich Nortje had all the time in the world and got under it but could not hold on  Chase added eight more runs and then slog swept Keshav Maharaj to deep midwicket where David Miller could not contend with the aerial ball and the wind and let a difficult chance slip  Then  Maharaj was at square leg when Mayers  on 13  swept to him and he put it down  But the worst of the lot  from a visual perspective  was when Mayers hit Markram down the ground  Rabada and Jansen converged on the ball and didn t call and collided into each other  Jansen had to leave the field but returned and Markram finished with 1 for 28 from his four overs  Missing  KG Rabada The success of South Africa s spinners meant Markram had no use of Rabada until the 18th over  making it the latest he has ever bowled in this format  Rabada had played 62 T20Is before this one and had bowled in the first four overs in 61 previous instances  The latest he has bowled before was in the fifth over   also against West Indies   in 2021  He has once before been introduced after the halfway stage  in the 11th over in IPL 2021  So this was different but still  he had an almost immediate impact  Rabada had seen enough to know pace off was the best option and his first delivery  to Akeal Hosein  could only be dabbed to short third  Hosein and Andre Russell ran but Anrich Nortje picked up and threw quicker and Russell was run out  Later in the over  Hosein hit a cutter straight back to Rabada  who took a simple catch  His first over cost only one run and held West Indies back from a late surge  He closed out with an over worth 11 runs to keep West Indies to 135  It s South Africa in a virtual World Cup knockout   did you need more drama  Yes  yes  you did  And it delivered  Quinton de Kock took 12 runs off the opening over to get the chase underway but then Russell got hold of the new ball  He strangled Reeza Hendricks down the leg side with his first ball   though the decision needed to be reviewed and reversed after Snicko confirmed the edge   and the had de Kock well caught by Sherfane Rutherford at deep backward square  But that was not where the early tension ended  At the end of that over  the heavens opened and an almighty shower came down  bringing with it memories of  1992  2003  2015 and many other rain affected matches that South Africans would prefer to forget  The delay lasted 75 minutes and three overs were lost  reducing the target to 123  Klaasen puts South Africa in front We all know T20 matches can change in an over but in a rain reduced match  that is even more amplified  Heinrich Klaasen provided the game changing passage of play when he took on Gudakesh Motie and broke the back of the chase to put South Africa on course for victory  Klaasen hit Motie s first ball into the stands and the last three for successive fours  albeit risky  He stayed on the back foot and hit Motie aerially towards Chase  who could not reach the chance despite a full stretched dive at backward point  then glanced him past short fine and edged it past Nicholas Pooran to leave South Africa needing 53 runs off 10 overs and clear the path to the semi finals ,South Africa knock West Indies out to enter semi final with nervy win  They survived a rain reduced match and successfully chased a tricky target to book the spot in the semi final ,Now  they ve  almost  done it all  After an undefeated streak of six matches  five of them far too close for comfort  South Africa have survived a rain reduced match and successfully chased a tricky target to book the spot in the semi final of the men s T20 World Cup 2024  They knocked co hosts West Indies out in the process and have topped their Super Eight group  which means they are also likely to avoid India in the final four  We ll say it again  is this their time  All the evidence points to a change of fortunes for a team that has so long coveted an ICC trophy and equally long  been denied  South Africa are now winning games they should be losing  scrapping like their rugby counterparts  the Springboks   who won the quarterfinals  semifinals and final  each by one point last year   and finding ways to overcome pressure  There s a new found tenacity to them and it s seen them get to a T20 World Cup knockout for the first time in a decade  Incidentally  when they got to the final four in the 2014 tournament  Aiden Markram had just led the Under 19 team to the World Cup  Now  he finds himself captaining the senior side and he is doing differently and to great success  Markram took the new ball in this match  and bowled himself for a full quota of four overs  He decided to rely on a non traditional strength  spin  South Africa had never bowled this many overs of spin in a T20 World Cup match  and only bowled more twice before against Sri Lanka in 2021  and the change of tack worked a charm  Between them  South Africa s spinners took 5 for 79 in 12 overs  They were largely responsible for keeping West Indies quiet and for several of the 57 dot balls West Indies faced in their innings   the equivalent of 9 3 overs   and the most at this T20 World Cup  Only an 81 run stand between Kyle Mayers and Roston Chase kept West Indies in the game  and they were the only two batters to get an individual score of more than 15  And once the tears have dried  West Indies will look to their batting as the major reason they were unable to advance  Their bowlers worked with what they had and had South Africa 15 for 2 in two overs  before the rain came down  They kept at and removed all the recognised batters  Chase s 3 for 12 and Joseph s 2 for 25 meant South Africa were always on tenterhooks but at seven down  Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen took it home  Markram gets funky but fielding gets messy An eventful first 10 overs saw South Africa drop four catches and Markram become just the second South Africa spinner to bowl four successive overs after opening the bowling in a men s T20I  and that was with two specialist spinners in the XI  Markram shared the new ball with Jansen  and got a wicket with his first ball  as South Africa won the early exchanges with West Indies 5 for 2 early on  They should have had a third in Jansen s next over  when Chase  on 12  swiped across the line and hit it straight up  Anrich Nortje had all the time in the world and got under it but could not hold on  Chase added eight more runs and then slog swept Keshav Maharaj to deep midwicket where David Miller could not contend with the aerial ball and the wind and let a difficult chance slip  Then  Maharaj was at square leg when Mayers  on 13  swept to him and he put it down  But the worst of the lot  from a visual perspective  was when Mayers hit Markram down the ground  Rabada and Jansen converged on the ball and didn t call and collided into each other  Jansen had to leave the field but returned and Markram finished with 1 for 28 from his four overs  Missing  KG Rabada The success of South Africa s spinners meant Markram had no use of Rabada until the 18th over  making it the latest he has ever bowled in this format  Rabada had played 62 T20Is before this one and had bowled in the first four overs in 61 previous instances  The latest he has bowled before was in the fifth over   also against West Indies   in 2021  He has once before been introduced after the halfway stage  in the 11th over in IPL 2021  So this was different but still  he had an almost immediate impact  Rabada had seen enough to know pace off was the best option and his first delivery  to Akeal Hosein  could only be dabbed to short third  Hosein and Andre Russell ran but Anrich Nortje picked up and threw quicker and Russell was run out  Later in the over  Hosein hit a cutter straight back to Rabada  who took a simple catch  His first over cost only one run and held West Indies back from a late surge  He closed out with an over worth 11 runs to keep West Indies to 135  It s South Africa in a virtual World Cup knockout   did you need more drama  Yes  yes  you did  And it delivered  Quinton de Kock took 12 runs off the opening over to get the chase underway but then Russell got hold of the new ball  He strangled Reeza Hendricks down the leg side with his first ball   though the decision needed to be reviewed and reversed after Snicko confirmed the edge   and the had de Kock well caught by Sherfane Rutherford at deep backward square  But that was not where the early tension ended  At the end of that over  the heavens opened and an almighty shower came down  bringing with it memories of  1992  2003  2015 and many other rain affected matches that South Africans would prefer to forget  The delay lasted 75 minutes and three overs were lost  reducing the target to 123  Klaasen puts South Africa in front We all know T20 matches can change in an over but in a rain reduced match  that is even more amplified  Heinrich Klaasen provided the game changing passage of play when he took on Gudakesh Motie and broke the back of the chase to put South Africa on course for victory  Klaasen hit Motie s first ball into the stands and the last three for successive fours  albeit risky  He stayed on the back foot and hit Motie aerially towards Chase  who could not reach the chance despite a full stretched dive at backward point  then glanced him past short fine and edged it past Nicholas Pooran to leave South Africa needing 53 runs off 10 overs and clear the path to the semi finals ,South Africa have survived a rain reduced match and successfully chased a tricky target to book the spot in the

07.txt,England have booked their place in the semi finals of the T20 World Cup 2024 with a commanding 10 wicket win over USA in their final Super Eight match  Using just 9 4 overs to chase down 116  thanks to Jos Buttler s 83 not out from 38 deliveries  the defending champions have boosted their net run rate  NRR  to 1 992 for good measure  Such a dominant win was set up by Chris Jordan  who became the first England player to take a men s T20I hat trick  Jordan  brought back into the XI for Mark Wood  took four wickets from his final five deliveries   joining Ireland s Curtis Campher as the only other bowler to achieve that feat at a T20 World Cup   as the USA collapsed from 115 for 5 to 115 all out  The co hosts had started well enough in Bridgetown  reaching 48 for 2 in their first six overs  But Adil Rashid continued a stellar campaign with a miserly 2 for 13 from his four overs  Aaron Jones  one of the USA s stronger players of spin  and top scorer Nitish Kumar were bowled by Rashid  who equalled Stuart Broad s tally of 30 dismissals in T20 World Cups  Both Rashid and Livingstone ensured only 25 runs were scored in the six overs after the powerplay  The target of 116 needed to be chased down in 18 4 overs to ensure England s NRR would go ahead of South Africa s and ensure they had a firm grasp on second place in the group  Buttler  however  was aiming higher  After a quiet start  Buttler raced to 44 from 26 deliveries at the end of the powerplay   in which England scored 60   which included cracking a solar panel with the first of two consecutive sixes off Saurabh Netravalkar  He saved his most brutal assault for Harmeet Singh s second over   the ninth   getting the strike for the second ball and striking five sixes  The first took him to his first half century of the tournament  from 32 deliveries  An over later  Buttler s late cut took England over the line with 62 balls to spare  It means England will finish top of the group if West Indies beat South Africa in Group 2 s final fixture by a margin fewer than 52 runs  A South Africa win  taking them to six points  will see England finish second  Jordan gets his moment Chris Jordan did not expect to be at this World Cup  A back injury to Jamie Overton handed him what is probably one last shot on the biggest stage  Today in Barbados  he seized it with both hands with that hat trick and overall figures of 4 for 10 that took him to 105 T20I wickets  The crescendo of the hat trick was dripping with emotion  Jordan is not exactly the biggest celebrator  but who could begrudge him this moment  The Bajan born cricketer grew up watching plenty of cricket at the Kensington Oval before making the move to the UK on a scholarship to Dulwich College  The locals in the stadium cheered him as one of their own  Jordan was actually at home in Barbados when he heard of his call up to the provisional squad at the end of April  Later that day  he was training in the nets with Jofra Archer  who initially put the session live on Instagram before taking it down  Having started in the XI for the washout against Scotland and loss to Australia   both in Bridgetown   Jordan returned for the final Group B match against Namibia before sitting back on the bench for the start of the Super Eights  Even after this display  he may find himself sidelined once more if Buttler opts for Mark Wood s extra pace  depending on England s opponents and semi final venue  Either way  Jordan s place in history has been secured  Rashid s wrong  un so right Like Lionel Messi shifting onto his left foot and Steph Curry pulling up from long range  everyone knows Adil Rashid has a googly  The problem with all three is doing something about it  Aaron Jones and Nitish Kumar were both felled by the legspinner s delivery that goes the other way  The former tried to combat it with his trusty slog sweep  The latter opted to blaze up and over extra cover  Both had their stumps rearranged  That s now five of Rashid s nine wickets that have come from googlies at this World Cup  Their menace is disguised by full lengths and outside off stump lines  similar to where he looks to land his leggies  Rashid has been England s standout white ball bowler for some time  and  aged 36  has been at his best throughout this tournament despite coming into the summer with little competitive cricket  Here in Bridgetown  he was unplayable  with just 10 runs conceded from his four boundary less overs  It was hard not to feel sorry for USA s batting line up as he tied them in knots  If it s any comfort  more seasoned batters  with plenty more exposure to Rashid  have been made to look just as clueless  Underwhelming Corey Anderson A lot was expected from Corey Anderson  Having made his debut for the USA in April  the former New Zealand international was meant to bring nous and X factor to the team after 93 caps and three World Cups as a Blackcap  Things have not panned out as such  It is as much a credit to the rest of the squad that their highest profile cricketer coming into this tournament has been a footnote on a valiant campaign  Anderson was averaging 13 coming into this final fixture  With six overs to go  he looked relatively set on 24  especially after breaking a boundary less run of 34 deliveries in the previous by heaving Liam Livingstone for six over gully with a reverse sweep  Now was his time to show why he was once one of the most sort after allrounders on the circuit  While there was a hurry up  it came at the end other end as Harmeet Singh struck 21 in a 27 run stand between them  with a couple of fours and a six of his own  Singh would fall at the end of the 18th over  leaving Anderson on strike for the penultimate over  Jordan bowled a full toss  and Anderson swung for the hills  Alas  he could only find Harry Brook  who did not have to move an inch from his position a good 10 yards in front of the sponge at long on  Off he walked for 29  his highest score of the competition  taking his overall tally to 66 from 72 deliveries  A tournament to remember for the USA is perhaps one to forget for Anderson  Buttler peaking at the right time for England  It has been an odd tournament for the England captain  Barring one or two tactical errors   the costliest being his gut decision to bowl Will Jacks in the second over against Australia   his captaincy has been sound  Behind the stumps  he has been immaculate  In front of them  however  he hadn t quite launched  A 28 ball 42 in the defeat to Australia and 24 off eight deliveries in the shellacking of Oman was tempered by a duck against Namibia  Across the first Super Eight matches against West Indies and South Africa  he managed just 42 from as many balls  As such  you could attribute this unbeaten 83   Buttler s second highest score in T20 World Cups   to a release of frustration  That s certainly how it seemed by the end  even if Buttler attributed the boundary bloodlust as merely the pursuit of a surer path to the knockout stages  His takedown of Harmeet Singh saw him become the second player in a T20I World Cup to strike five sixes in an over after Yuvraj Singh lit up the Durban skies against Stuart Broad in 2007  Having started the month in a foul mood  fed up of addressing the 50 over shambles in India last winter  Buttler looks far more at ease  And why not   after a few bumps  this title defence remains on track ,With a semi final spot on the line  Australia s top order was wiped out by Afghanistan s seamers  Glenn Maxwell then pulled off one trick shot after another to counter Afghanistan and leave them feeling a sense of déjà vu  One shovelled four off Azmatullah Omarzai had Maxwell grinning from ear to ear  After he brought up a 35 ball half century  Maxwell put his thumbs up to the Australia dressing room and looked set to secure their place in the final four and KO Afghanistan once again  Gulbadin Naib  though  combined with Noor Ahmad to stop Maxwell on 59 off 41 balls and keep Afghanistan alive in this T20 World Cup  After Naib hid one away from Maxwell s swinging arc  Noor pulled off a spectacular  low catch at backward point  Maxwell s exit left Australia at 106 for 6 in the 15th over  still needing 43 off 32 balls on the St Vincent pitch that offered sharp turn and variable bounce  Naib used those conditions to his advantage to come away with career best T20I figures of 4 for 20 to help bowl Australia out for 127  Brought in as their eighth bowler  Naib took out Maxwell  Marcus Stoinis  Tim David and Pat Cummins to headline Afghanistan s famous victory  their first over Australia across formats  Earlier  Cummins had bagged a hat trick in consecutive World Cup games  and almost got four in four  but this was indeed Naib and Afghanistan s day  The opening act Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran struck up their third century stand in this tournament   they became the first pair to do so in any T20I series   to set Afghanistan up for a competitive total  Both openers made half centuries  leaving Australia waiting until the 16th over for a breakthrough  Never have Australia had to wait that long for a wicket in T20Is  Gurbaz and Ibrahim had played out 21 dots in the first four overs in which they managed only 17  But in the next two overs they more than doubled the score  ending the powerplay on 40 for 0  Gurbaz then jumped out of his crease and pumped Adam Zampa for a straight six while Ibrahim manufactured swinging room and crunched Ashton Agar over cover point for four  Australia had picked the left arm fingerspinner  ahead of Mitchell Starc  to match him up with a right hander heavy Afghanistan line up on a spin friendly surface  but he went wicketless  4 1 17 0   Gurbaz and Ibrahim largely played percentage shots to counter the conditions and Australia s attack  Ibrahim could ve been dismissed on 11 had Zampa not dropped a difficult chance in the outfield  he ended up parrying it away to the boundary  Ibrahim got another life on 32 when Stoinis shelled a return catch  Australia continued to be uncharacteristically sloppy in the field  and Afghanistan capitalised on the many missed chances  The comeback Cummins led Australia s comeback at the death by claiming his second hat trick in three days  On Saturday in St Vincent  he dismissed Rashid Khan  Karim Janat and Naib across the 18th and 20th overs  When he performed the feat against Bangladesh  Cummins said that he forgot he was on a hat trick  but on Saturday against Afghanistan  he was aware of it  putting his hands up in celebration even before Maxwell had caught the ball  Cummins could ve well had four in four had David Warner not dropped Nangeyalia Kharote off the next ball  From 118 for 0 in the 16th over  Afghanistan finished with 148 for 6  and it was anyone s game at the halfway mark  Naveen s double strike Afghanistan have become used to Fazalhaq Farooqi striking repeatedly in the powerplay  but here it was Naveen ul Haq who wrecked Australia s top order  After taking the first two balls away from Travis Head  Naveen threatened to bring one back into the batter with the angle from around the wicket  but the ball swung and seamed away wickedly to make Head look silly and crash into the middle stump  In his next over  Naveen had Mitchell Marsh slicing a catch to mid off with a 108kph slower ball that would ve done Dwayne Bravo  the Afghanistan bowling consultant and Naveen s team mate at Texas Super Kings  proud  Hello again  Maxwell Australia were 16 for 2 in three overs  Enter Maxwell  He set to work with two fours off Omarzai in a space of three balls and then dumped rookie left arm spinner Kharote out of the attack  He first reverse swept Kharote past slip for four and slog swept him powerfully over midwicket in a 13 run over  Kharote was done with the ball after just one over  Maxwell also took some calculated risks against Rashid and kept Australia in touch with the asking rate  When he reached his half century with a six off Naib  the ghosts of Mumbai 2023 might have resurfaced for Afghanistan  Naib flexes his muscles Naib  though  helped them exorcise the ghosts  Australia were 94 for 5 in 13 overs  with Maxwell and finisher Wade in the middle  Naib had already removed Stoinis and David in his first two overs  He wasn t even part of Afghanistan s Plan A  With the spinners erring full  especially against Maxwell  Rashid turned to Naib  who responded with two more wickets  Naib doesn t have high pace  but he kept hitting the surface and had the ball react differently off it  After getting rid of Maxwell in his third over  he flexed his muscles and let out an almighty roar that might have been heard in Kabul  The Afghanistan fans in St Vincent roared with their hero and waved the flags  In his final over  Naib fooled Cummins with a slower cutter before Naveen and Omarzai sealed the deal for Afghanistan ,England have booked their place in the semi finals of the T20 World Cup 2024 with a commanding 10 wicket win over USA in their final Super Eight match  Using just 9 4 overs to chase down 116  thanks to Jos Buttler s 83 not out from 38

08.txt,By the time India wakes up on Sunday  it is possible their team might have qualified for the semi finals of the T20 World Cup 2024  They were too good for Bangladesh in Antigua  a total of 196 built by series of quickfire cameos in defiance of a slow pitch carrying them through to victory by 50 runs  If Australia beat Afghanistan  both they and India will move into the final four  The opening conundrum Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as a partnership has won many a match for India  but at this T20 World Cup  they are yet to click  There was even a moment s confusion when they were running between the wickets  Rohit unsure of whether there was a single on to midwicket s right  It was stop start but they eventually got the run  The team will hope the same thing happens to them as the tournament goes on because pairing them together at the top of the order is allowing India to pack their middle order with six hitters  That advantage is helping them post par plus totals in tough conditions  Bangladesh s bright spot Tanzim Hasan did as much as he could to mess with that plan  He was Bangladesh s best bowler and he earned that mantle by doing the one thing a big hitter hates  He was unpredictable  Kohli came charging to meet him but he did the batter with change of pace and let him have it with a send off  Suryakumar Yadav managed to get a six away first ball but was overwhelmed by extra bounce the next delivery  Tanzim s slower balls gripped and misbehaved off the pitch  And when he went on pace  he made sure to hit the pitch hard to extract variation in bounce  India s counterattack Rishabh Pant was the firestarter  After India went from 71 for 1 to 77 for 3  they suffered nine balls without a boundary  Sometimes  in good batting conditions  that s the price you pay  These weren t good batting conditions  The pitch and the outfield were slow  They couldn t wait till the death overs to make up the difference  Fully aware of that  Pant  who was 12 off 15  burst to life  A left hander s cover drive is usually a thing of beauty but the one that Mustafizur had to endure was something else  It was power stripped to its purest essence  It was chilling  Pant hit five boundaries in eight balls and fell looking for another one  The highlight Rishad Hossain will no longer be denied  Having had to wait because the culture in Bangladesh does not rate wristspinners   even as the rest of the world made it plain they were game changers  he has arrived at this T20 World Cup as their most exciting cricketer  His dismissal of Pant secured Bangladesh their best period of play in this game   2 4 overs of singles and dots between the 12th and the 15th  He took two wickets as well  both of batters looking to attack him  Pant caught off the reverse sweep and Dube bowled neck and crop  He may have given a few runs away but he never took a backward step  Not even when he had to bowl one of the death overs  The half centurion Hardik broke India free of their second lull  They were 120 for 4 at the start of the 15th over  He was 6 off 7  Then he got a gift from Mahedi Hasan   a long hop with room to free the arms   and that was that  A lot of his power game comes from having incredible strength in his core and in his forearms  That s why he s able to hit even yorkers for boundaries  That s why he doesn t always need a full swing of the bat  That s why he should be a little more adventurous than he lets himself be now  Although he came in only in the 12th over  and had faced only 18 deliveries by the 18th  his ability to access the boundary   each of the four that came in the last two overs were off his bat   helped him score a fifty  This was the kind of innings India could never imagine  Even the stats bore that out  Only once before  in their entire history of T20Is  had they made more than the 196 they did on Saturday with none of their top five batters scoring a fifty  They re usually freight trains  slow to start  but steadily picking up steam  At this World Cup  they re finding a new identity  Four of the seven batters who went out there scored at a strike rate of 150 or more  Twenty eight balls was the longest anyone spent in the middle because everyone was looking to take risks  The chase Bangladesh s opening partnership had provided only 13 runs in five previous innings  Given how crucial it is to start a big chase well  they were already at a handicap  Tanzid Hasan  coming off back to back ducks  finished less than a run a ball  Litton Das didn t survive the powerplay  although he was done in by a lovely slower ball from Hardik  who also made sure to drag the offbreak wide of the right hand batter s hitting arc  securing a mis hit that was caught at deep midwicket  A batting team at 67 for 2 after 10 overs should have put up more of a fight but Bangladesh ran into Kuldeep Yadav and never recovered  The googly caught Tanzid unawares for 29 off 31  The legbreak had Towhid Hridoy lbw on the slog sweep  And finally  he was also up to task when Shakib Al Hasan was looking to hit him out of the ground  A simple shift of line slightly wider outside the off stump messed with the left hand batter s hitting arc and had him caught at cover  Bangladesh actually ended up attacking more balls than India did in this game   49 to 48   but a lot of them were panicked swings  It goes to show that clarity is crucial in T20 cricket  Kuldeep denied them that because they couldn t pick the ball out of his hand  Jasprit Bumrah played his part as well  15 of his 24 deliveries yielding dots along with two wickets ,Hardik and Kuldeep lead India to their second win in the Super Eight  Bangladesh are on the brink of elimination after losing by 50 runs in Antigua ,By the time India wakes up on Sunday  it is possible their team might have qualified for the semi finals of the T20 World Cup 2024  They were too good for Bangladesh in Antigua  a total of 196 built by series of quickfire cameos in defiance of a slow pitch carrying them through to victory by 50 runs  If Australia beat Afghanistan  both they and India will move into the final four  The opening conundrum Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as a partnership has won many a match for India  but at this T20 World Cup  they are yet to click  There was even a moment s confusion when they were running between the wickets  Rohit unsure of whether there was a single on to midwicket s right  It was stop start but they eventually got the run  The team will hope the same thing happens to them as the tournament goes on because pairing them together at the top of the order is allowing India to pack their middle order with six hitters  That advantage is helping them post par plus totals in tough conditions  Bangladesh s bright spot Tanzim Hasan did as much as he could to mess with that plan  He was Bangladesh s best bowler and he earned that mantle by doing the one thing a big hitter hates  He was unpredictable  Kohli came charging to meet him but he did the batter with change of pace and let him have it with a send off  Suryakumar Yadav managed to get a six away first ball but was overwhelmed by extra bounce the next delivery  Tanzim s slower balls gripped and misbehaved off the pitch  And when he went on pace  he made sure to hit the pitch hard to extract variation in bounce  India s counterattack Rishabh Pant was the firestarter  After India went from 71 for 1 to 77 for 3  they suffered nine balls without a boundary  Sometimes  in good batting conditions  that s the price you pay  These weren t good batting conditions  The pitch and the outfield were slow  They couldn t wait till the death overs to make up the difference  Fully aware of that  Pant  who was 12 off 15  burst to life  A left hander s cover drive is usually a thing of beauty but the one that Mustafizur had to endure was something else  It was power stripped to its purest essence  It was chilling  Pant hit five boundaries in eight balls and fell looking for another one  The highlight Rishad Hossain will no longer be denied  Having had to wait because the culture in Bangladesh does not rate wristspinners   even as the rest of the world made it plain they were game changers  he has arrived at this T20 World Cup as their most exciting cricketer  His dismissal of Pant secured Bangladesh their best period of play in this game   2 4 overs of singles and dots between the 12th and the 15th  He took two wickets as well  both of batters looking to attack him  Pant caught off the reverse sweep and Dube bowled neck and crop  He may have given a few runs away but he never took a backward step  Not even when he had to bowl one of the death overs  The half centurion Hardik broke India free of their second lull  They were 120 for 4 at the start of the 15th over  He was 6 off 7  Then he got a gift from Mahedi Hasan   a long hop with room to free the arms   and that was that  A lot of his power game comes from having incredible strength in his core and in his forearms  That s why he s able to hit even yorkers for boundaries  That s why he doesn t always need a full swing of the bat  That s why he should be a little more adventurous than he lets himself be now  Although he came in only in the 12th over  and had faced only 18 deliveries by the 18th  his ability to access the boundary   each of the four that came in the last two overs were off his bat   helped him score a fifty  This was the kind of innings India could never imagine  Even the stats bore that out  Only once before  in their entire history of T20Is  had they made more than the 196 they did on Saturday with none of their top five batters scoring a fifty  They re usually freight trains  slow to start  but steadily picking up steam  At this World Cup  they re finding a new identity  Four of the seven batters who went out there scored at a strike rate of 150 or more  Twenty eight balls was the longest anyone spent in the middle

by Roston Chase was followed up by a chase that was sledgehammer like in its brutality  Shai Hope crunched an unbeaten 82 off 39 balls  smashing eight sixes along the way as Nicholas Pooran helped him

against South Africa with an unbeaten 80 off 47  stormed to a flier once more  punishing the length deliveries of Joseph to help plunder 35 off the final three of the powerplay  It helped USA put on 48 in the first six   their second highest powerplay score at this World Cup  But with large parts of the middle order misfiring since their early couple of wins  USA needed Gous to press on as he did

and take the game deep  they were chasing net run rate as well as points in Barbados  Once Joseph had cleared Gous from the path  Chase and Gudakesh Motie had free rein to run rings round the rest  A bit of extra turn did for Nitish Kumar  but it was the Chase show from there  Aaron Jones had just walloped a 101m six  but it didn t stop Chase bravely flighting the first ball of the spell up to him

10.txt,Is it too early to say it  That it looks like South Africa s time has come  They beat defending champions England in a thrilling encounter  overcoming several scares in Saint Lucia to remain unbeaten in T20 World Cup 2024  South Africa didn t seem to have enough runs  having scored 63 in the powerplay but only another 100 in the next 14 overs  They seemed to have got their selection slightly wrong on a slower than expected pitch by picking only one specialist spinner  who they had bowled out by the 13th over of England s chase  And their quicks did not appear to have fully bought into pace off  giving away 52 runs in three overs between the 15th and 17th over to leave England needing only 25 runs off the last 18 balls  But then  Kagiso Rabada had Liam Livingstone caught at deep backward square off a full toss   and celebrated in his face   and he only gave away four runs in his final over  Marco Jansen sent down a phenomenal penultimate over  bowling into the pitch and taking pace off  and conceded only seven runs  leaving Anrich Nortje with 13 to defend off the last over  His first ball was hit down the ground by Harry Brook  in search of six  but Aiden Markam ran back from mid on and took the catch over his shoulder  That was the moment the game was won but Nortje still had five deliveries and he kept it together  bowling full  and restricting England to six runs in the 20th over  The drama aside  England may not too be unhappy after the close defeat  Their spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid were impressive  taking 2 for 45 in 7 overs  Reece Topley conceded only 23 in his four overs  and Harry Brook brought up his first T20 World Cup fifty  The shot selection from the top order may come under scrutiny but with a positive net run rate and a game against the USA to come  England will still fancy their chances of reaching the semi final  De Kock wins match ups and gets a life England s planning against Quinton de Kock was spot on as they chose to open the bowling with Reece Topley and Moeen Ali  both of whom have had the better of de Kock in the past  Topley had dismissed him four times in six meetings  and Moeen six times in 15  but neither got the early breakthrough in this game  Instead  de Kock opened the boundary count with a four and a six down the ground off Moeen and then punished Jofra Archer with a series of pick up shots over the leg side  Archer s opening over cost 21 and de Kock scored 17 of them  including successive sixes  De Kock went on to bring up fifty off 22 balls  equalling Aaron Jones for the fastest half century of the tournament  but could have been out two overs later  on 58  when he slog swept an Adil Rashid googly to deep backward square  Mark Wood had to reach forward to take the catch  which appeared clean until TV umpire Joel Wilson determined the ball had burst through his fingers and hit the ground  Buttler brilliant in the field De Kock added just seven more runs before Archer got his revenge  He banged in a short  slower ball  de Kock edged and Jos Buttler leapt one handed to his left and hung on to a humdinger  And that was the entree  Buttler s main course came when Heinrich Klaasen  on 8  responded late to the non striker David Miller s call for a run  after a short ball from Wood had deflected off the wicketkeeper s pad towards short fine leg  Klaasen was slow between the wickets and Buttler pounced  showing incredible awareness and aim to throw the stumps down at the non striker s end with Klaasen well short  The sublime  ridiculous and the sublime England can catch  Hold my beer  said South Africa  as Reeza Hendricks grabbed on to the first chance they were given  Phil Salt was tempted into an aerial drive off Rabada but did not hit it as well as he hoped and Hendricks leapt two handed to his left to hold on to a spectacular catch  Rabada should have had a second when Bairstow slashed him to deep third  but Klaasen was unable to hold on  The drop only cost South Africa six runs due to another wonder catch  Keshav Maharaj tossed the ball up  Bairstow cut and Nortje flung himself to his right at backward point to grab a stunner  And Klaasen was able to redeem himself when Buttler tried to take Maharaj on and was caught at deep mid wicket  None of those catches  however  compares with what Markram did in the final over when Harry Brook  set on 53  tried to hit Nortje down the ground  He ran back from mid on and took the catch over his right shoulder  it was the final turning point in the game  Rabada  Baartman miss their lengths England needed 77 runs off the last six overs and with Keshav Maharaj bowled out  it was up to the seamers to defend starting with South Africa s most experienced  Rabada  Tasked with the 15th over  Rabada bowled pace on and conceded six first up when Liam Livingstone hit him over square leg  He ended up giving away 18 runs in the over to take some pressure off England  But it was Baartman s third over  the 17th  which was the most disappointing from a South African perspective  He tried to find a yorker length but sent down four full tosses in a row  which Livingstone hit through cover  twice  for four and then over square leg  His fourth delivery was toe ended without damage but a fifth full toss to end the over gave Brook another four and set the game up for a thrilling finish ,South Africa

11.txt,Adam Zampa led the charge through Bangladesh s middle overs  before Pat Cummins claimed a hat trick at the death as Australia made a commanding start to the Super Eight  Outside of a 58 run second wicket stand between Litton Das and Najmul Hossain Shanto  Bangladesh were unable to string together any dominant periods with the bat  The result was them stumbling to 140 for 8 from their 20 overs  Although the North Sound pitch was on the slower side  and assisted the spinners  this was always going to be difficult to defend  David Warner and Travis Head combined to blast 65 for Australia in the first 6 5 overs  and though Bangladesh s spinners imposed themselves after that  Australia were always cruising  They were 28 runs ahead when showers interrupted play  there had been squalls blowing through all evening   Zampa halts Bangladesh At 57 for 1 at the end of the eighth over  and two set batters in  Bangladesh were in a reasonable position from which to raise the tempo a little  But they were up against one of the canniest middle overs operators going  Zampa slid in a fast arm ball  that Litton failed to hit with his sweep shot  and wound up bowled  Later  Zampa also hit Shanto in front of the stumps with a fast legbreak  removing Bangladesh s top scorer of the evening  All up  he collected figures of 2 for 24 from his four overs  Cummins  hat trick The last three overs were not fruitful for Bangladesh  who scored only 23 runs  Cummins  wicket taking was chiefly responsible for Australia controlling that period of the game  His first two wickets came from back of a length deliveries outside off  Mahmudullah tried to pull one through midwicket and ended up bottom edging the ball into his stumps  Mahedi Hasan tried to ramp it  but provided only a neat catch to deep third  Then  first ball of the final over  Cummins outwitted Towhid Hridoy by bowling a slower  length ball to the batter  who only scooped it over the shoulder to short fine leg  This was Australia s fourth hat trick in this format  but only the second in a World Cup  The first was by Brett Lee in 2007  also against Bangladesh  Warner and Head race out of the blocks It didn t take long for Australia s openers to impose themselves  Warner hit the second ball of the innings   bowled by Mahedi Hasan   for four with a reverse sweep  But it was in the fourth over  bowled by Taskin Ahmed  that they really got going  with both batters clubbing straight boundaries  before Head lifted a shortish delivery into the stands beyond cow corner  They plundered 59 in the powerplay  Though Bangladesh legspinner Rishad Hossain claimed two wickets in his first two overs  Head and Warner had got Australia well ahead of the required rate ,Warner leads Australia s charge after the Zampa

this was always going to be difficult to defend  David Warner and Travis Head combined to blast 65 for Australia in the first 6 5 overs  and though Bangladesh s spinners imposed themselves after that  Australia were always cruising  They were 28 runs ahead when showers interrupted play  there had been squalls blowing through all evening   Zampa halts Bangladesh At 57 for 1 at the end of the eighth over  and two set batters in  Bangladesh were in a reasonable position from which to raise the tempo a little  But they were up against one of the canniest middle overs operators going  Zampa slid in a fast arm ball  that Litton failed to hit with his sweep shot  and wound up bowled  Later  Zampa also hit Shanto in front of the stumps with a fast legbreak  removing Bangladesh s top scorer of the evening  All up  he collected figures of 2 for 24 from his four overs  Cummins  hat trick The last three overs were not fruitful for Bangladesh  who scored only 23 runs  Cummins  wicket taking was chiefly responsible for Australia controlling that period of the game  His first two wickets came from back of a length deliveries outside off  Mahmudullah tried to pull one through midwicket and ended up bottom edging the ball into his stumps  Mahedi Hasan tried to ramp it  but provided only a neat catch to deep third  Then  first ball of the final over  Cummins outwitted Towhid Hridoy by bowling a slower  length ball to the batter  who only scooped it over the shoulder to short fine leg  This was Australia s fourth hat trick in this format  but only the second in a World Cup  The first was by Brett Lee in 2007  also against Bangladesh  Warner and Head race out of the blocks It didn t take long for Australia s openers to impose themselves  Warner hit the second ball of the innings   bowled by Mahedi Hasan   for four with a reverse sweep  But it was in the fourth over  bowled by Taskin Ahmed  that they really got going  with both batters clubbing straight boundaries  before Head lifted a shortish delivery into the stands beyond cow corner  They plundered 59 in the powerplay  Though Bangladesh legspinner Rishad Hossain claimed two wickets in his first two overs  Head and Warner had got Australia well ahead of the required rate ,Australia made a commanding start to the Super Eight. David Warner and Travis Head combined to blast 65 for Australia in the first 6 5 overs. Adam Zampa led the charge through Bangladesh s middle overs before Pat Cummins claimed a hat trick at the death.,0.07114624505928853,0.015873015873015872,0.05533596837944664,0.3055555555555556,0.0,0.16666666666666669,0.5119114794593667,1.3559070724704323,0.5023,0.0010000000000000009,-0.0516,-0.023000000000000007

unforgiving mood  An attempted reverse sweep brought a subdued lbw appeal before a conventional sweep  a 76 metre six heaved into the stands at midwicket  and a fortuitous inside edge brought 14 from

And while Rashid s snaring of Russell was the icing on the cake in this little stanza that shifted the match England s way  it was Archer s in the 17th over that vindicated Buttler s investment  Over the wicket to Pooran  Archer hammered a tight line across the left hander  Ranging from full and yorker length  barring one misstep   a full toss third ball which Pooran guided through point for four

14.txt,Another game  another close one for South Africa and they seem to be making a habit of sneaking over the line at the T20 World Cup 2024  This time  they were pushed by USA  who gave an excellent account of themselves in their first Super Eight match  On a batter friendly pitch  USA kept South Africa to under 200 from 126 for 1 in the 13th over  Quinton de Kock s first half century of the tournament set South Africa up  before Saurabh Netravalkar and Harmeet Singh took 3 for 15 between them  but the rest of the attack could not provide enough support  Heinrich Klaasen and Tristan Stubbs shared a fifth wicket partnership of 53 to give South Africa a competitive total to defend  USA were off to a bright start thanks to Steven Taylor but Kagiso Rabada s double strike in the Powerplay kept things even  Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi squeezed USA through the middle but South African born Andries Gous very nearly had a decisive say on proceedings  His unbeaten 80 and his 91 run stand with Harmeet   the second highest for the sixth wicket or lower in all T20 World Cups   took USA to within 28 runs of victory  with two overs left  Ultimately  Rabada and Anrich Nortje kept USA at bay and South Africa earned their first Super Eight points  Only a matter of time for de Kock It had to be  After scores of 20  0  18 and 10  de Kock  in what could be his last international assignment  finally brought out the big guns  He didn t hit South Africa s first boundary   that was Reeza Hendricks  six over cover   and waited until the fourth over before he properly got hold of one but when he did  he did not stop  De Kock pulled Jasdeep Singh through midwicket and then hit him for three successive sixes  all with the wind into the leg side  Jasdeep s first over cost 28 runs  just 10 fewer than South Africa s highest Powerplay of the tournament before this match  and set them up for a score of 64 for 1 at the end of the fielding restrictions  De Kock went on to bring up fifty with a six off Corey Anderson  off the 26th ball he faced and to his highest T20 World Cup score  74  Catching on point  The bowling  Not always  USA s fielding got them back into the game from Anderson s excellent judgement to take a skier off Hendricks  top edge in the third over to Shayan Jahangir judging his distance from the boundary rope well at cow corner to end de Kock s knock  But it was Ali Khan  who dived forward as he ran in from the deep backward point fence and held on to the grab that could have changed the innings  Aiden Markram was on 46 and hit the last ball of the 15th over in Ali s direction  He took a stunner to deny South Africa s captain the chance to push the score above 200  Despite all that  USA still gave away 53 runs in the last five overs and will not be entirely happy with some of their bowling  While Netravalkar and Harmeet s eight overs cost just 45 runs with four wickets and only four fours  the other five bowlers delivered 12 overs for 148 runs  took no wickets and gave away nine fours and 10 sixes  Rabada roars back Rabada has operated somewhat in the shadows in the group stage of the T20 World Cup and took just four wickets for 84 runs in four matches  With South Africa looking at using two specialist spinners  the debate ahead of this match was which of the three seamers to leave out  On form  both Nortje and Ottneil Baartman made strong cases to stay in the XI ahead of Rabada but the decision was made to leave Baartman out in favour of Rabada s experience  He repaid that call by removing an aggressive looking Taylor with his third ball  in the fourth over  and seemed to be ramping up his pace as his spell developed  In his next over  Rabada had Nitish Kumar caught at deep square leg off a length ball on the pads and put South Africa in front with USA 53 for 2 after the Powerplay  He came back to bowl the penultimate over  with USA needing 28 runs off the last 12 balls and broke the

Gous gets a hold of some of home Welkom s Andries Gous is from the same place as Dean Elgar and was part of the group of South Africans who took up offers to play in the Minor League just as the Covid 19 pandemic hit  He made his international debut three months ago and relished the chance to play against the country of his birth and let them have it  He gave himself some time to get his eye in and hit his first boundary off the sixth ball he faced  off Rabada  He sent Marco Jansen for six over long on and then laid into Nortje  18 runs off the last four balls of his third over  That included back to back sixes  the second was over midwicket and also brought up Gous  half century  off 33 balls  But he saved the best for the 18th over  when he hit Shamsi for successive sixes to keep USA in the game  They needed 50 from the last three overs and then just 28 off the last two  Gous finished unbeaten on a career best 80 ,De Kock and Rabada provide cutting edge as SA beat USA  Andries Gous made an unbeaten 80 for the co hosts but in the end it wasn t enough ,Another game  another close one for South Africa and they seem to be making a habit of sneaking over the line at the T20 World Cup 2024  This time  they were pushed by USA  who gave an excellent account of themselves in their first Super Eight match  On a batter friendly pitch  USA kept South Africa to under 200 from 126 for 1 in the 13th over  Quinton de Kock s first half century of the tournament set South Africa up  before Saurabh Netravalkar and Harmeet Singh took 3 for 15 between them  but the rest of the attack could not provide enough support  Heinrich Klaasen and Tristan Stubbs shared a fifth wicket partnership of 53 to give South Africa a competitive total to defend  USA were off to a bright start thanks to Steven Taylor but Kagiso Rabada s double strike in the Powerplay kept things even  Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi squeezed USA through the middle but South African born Andries Gous very nearly had a decisive say on proceedings  His unbeaten 80 and his 91 run stand with Harmeet   the second highest for the sixth wicket or lower in all T20 World Cups   took USA to within 28 runs of victory  with two overs left  Ultimately  Rabada and Anrich Nortje kept USA at bay and South Africa earned their first Super Eight points  Only a matter of time for de Kock It had to be  After scores of 20  0  18 and 10  de Kock  in what could be his last international assignment  finally brought out the big guns  He didn t hit South Africa s first boundary   that was Reeza Hendricks  six over cover   and waited until the fourth over before he properly got hold of one but when he did  he did not stop  De Kock pulled Jasdeep Singh through midwicket and then hit him for three successive sixes  all with the wind into the leg side  Jasdeep s first over cost 28 runs  just 10 fewer than South Africa s highest Powerplay of the tournament before this match  and set them up for a score of 64 for 1 at the end of the fielding restrictions  De Kock went on to bring up fifty with a six off Corey Anderson  off the 26th ball he faced and to his highest T20 World Cup score  74  Catching on point  The bowling  Not always  USA s fielding got them back into the game from Anderson s excellent judgement to take a skier off Hendricks  top edge in the third over to Shayan Jahangir judging his distance from the boundary rope well at cow corner to end de Kock s knock  But it was Ali Khan  who dived forward as he ran in from the deep backward point fence and held on to the grab that could have changed the innings  Aiden Markram was on 46 and hit the last ball of the 15th over in Ali s direction  He took a stunner to deny South Africa s captain the chance to push the score above 200  Despite all that  USA still gave away 53 runs in the last five overs and will not be entirely happy with some of their bowling  While Netravalkar and Harmeet s eight overs cost just 45 runs with four wickets and only four fours  the other five bowlers delivered 12 overs for 148 runs  took no wickets and gave away nine fours and 10 sixes  Rabada roars back Rabada has operated somewhat in the shadows in the group stage of the T20 World Cup and took just four wickets for 84 runs in four matches  With South Africa looking at using two specialist spinners  the debate ahead of this match was which of the three seamers to leave out  On form  both Nortje and Ottneil Baartman made strong cases to stay in the XI ahead of Rabada but the decision was made to leave Baartman out in favour of Rabada s experience  He repaid that call by removing an aggressive looking Taylor with his third ball  in the fourth over  and seemed to be ramping up his pace as his spell developed  In his next over  Rabada had Nitish

17.txt,Sri Lanka ended their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign in a resounding fashion with a dominant 83 run win over Netherlands in Gros Islet  It meant they ended on three points and third place in Group D behind South Africa and Bangladesh  who had confirmed their place in the Super Eight after beating Nepal in Kingstown  Sri Lanka s victory set up by their batters and finished off clinically by the bowlers  Nuwan Thushara was the pick of the bunch with figures of 3 for 24  but each of Maheesh Theekshana  Wanindu Hasaranga  Dasun Shanaka and Matheesha Pathirana also got in on the act as Netherlands were knocked out and bowled out 118 in chase of 202  Charith Asalanka had led the way for Sri Lanka with a blistering 46 off 21  which itself followed solid efforts from Kusal Mendis  46 off 29  and Dhananjaya de Silva  34 off 26   Jet fuel was then poured on proceedings by Angelo Mathews  30 off 15  and Hasaranga  20 off six   as Sri Lanka became just the second team to breach 200 this tournament  Netherlands briefly flirted with an improbable chase when Michael Levitt was going strong in the powerplay  but once the first wicket fell the rest offered up little resistance as Sri Lanka s varied attack proved too tough to handle  Sri Lanka keep things ticking Losing Pathum Nissanka second ball put paid to any notion that Sri Lanka might come out all guns blazing  but a steady rotation of strike in the powerplay mitigated the lack of early boundary striking   the powerplay saw four fours and a solitary six  but they managed to score 45 runs despite losing two wickets  By the end of the tenth over Sri Lanka s boundary count remained in single digits  but the continued consistent running between the wickets ensured that they maintained a healthy run rate  Between overs seven and ten only two boundaries were struck  but Sri Lanka nevertheless found themselves at a healthy 74 for 2 at the halfway stage of their innings  A shift in gears was however necessary on a ground in which 181 was chased down just a day prior  and this occurred swiftly and suddenly in the 13th over  as Dhananjaya pounded Paul van Meekeren for three consecutive boundaries   using the strong cross breeze to great effect  SL batters arrive belatedly Sri Lanka s batting had been under heavy scrutiny coming into this game  particularly their middle order  which had been guilty of not showing enough intent and purpose  Here though they fired on all cylinders  From the 13th to the 20th over only one of those went without a six being scored  as Sri Lanka plundered 77 runs off the final five overs  Asalanka  Mathews and Hasaranga all had impressive showings  feasting on the Dutch bowlers  inability to nail their lengths with most deliveries proving either too full or too short  The result was a score that was always likely to be a stretch too far against this Sri Lanka bowling attack  Leave it to Levitt He might have had only 12 T20Is to his name  but 20 year old Michael Levitt had already made quite the impression  having made his debut earlier this year  Leading up to this game  in just 12 T20Is he had already racked up 368 runs at an average of 33 45 and strike rate of 150 20  including two fifties and a century  Regardless of opposition those are impressive numbers  and here against a challenging Sri Lankan attack  he  briefly  lived up to the hype  He took on both Thushara and Theekshana in his 23 ball 31  the highlight of which was a sumptuous back foot lofted cover drive off the latter for six  His inexperience showed when he charged and was stumped off Theekshana  but the future certainly does seem to be bright for the youngster  SL bowlers take over Levitt  s wicket towards the end of the powerplay followed Max O Dowd s an over prior  It meant two new batters were at the crease  but the required run rate remained as steep as ever  What followed was a crash course in intent without execution  Vikramjit Singh fell pulling as Kamindu Mendis completed a very unique bobbling  juggling catch  while Sybrand Engelbrecht   having managed a sweet straight six off Hasaranga   would fall a short while later trying the same off Matheesha Pathirana

20.txt,Scotland could almost touch a history making moment  Australia s asking rate was approaching 13 going into the final seven overs of their chase in what  until then  had been an underwhelming performance  But Marcus Stoinis  with help from Travis Head and later Tim David  shattered their dreams and in turn left England breathing a sigh of relief in Antigua  the result securing their Super Eight berth in the T20 World Cup 2024  Stoinis  who mixed deftness and power in another impressive performance in what is becoming an outstanding tournament for him  put it back in Australia s favour with a 25 ball half century while Head turned on the afterburners after compiling a somewhat sedate 45 ball fifty with three sixes off consecutive legitimate deliveries  Although both departed  Australia entered the last over needing just five but there was one final twist  With three needed off four balls  David was dropped at deep midwicket by Chris Sole and with that went Scotland s last hope  The next ball was sent into the stands  For three quarters of the contest  Scotland had been outstanding  Their platform was laid by a blistering display from Brandon McMullen on one of the better batting surfaces of the tournament so far  Australia  who shelled six chances in a poor fielding display  clawed it back in the second 10 overs but in their powerplay were held to 36 for 2 by some excellent bowling  However  ultimately the depth and power of their batting order was too much leaving a host of emotions across two islands  Deftness and power from Stoinis Australia could not get up or ahead of the asking rate through the first half of the innings  When Glenn Maxwell  who had struck one six over long on  was defeated by a wonderful delivery from Mark Watt  which pitched on off stump and straightened  Scotland were buoyant and there was a sense that Australia could pay for being off the pace  However  Stoinis got away from his first ball with the help of a misfield  square cutting one of Watt s 24 yard deliveries  So often known for sheer brute force  he then deftly reverse swept Michael Leask from the first delivery of the next over and looked on his game  Still  the requirement had become a demanding 87 off 39 balls when Stoinis took down Leask with a reverse hit six over point then another down the ground  When Head slammed three sixes off Safyaan Sharif the tide had firmly turned  at one stage a series of 12 legitimate deliveries brought 46 runs  Sharif did strike back to have Head taken at long off  but Australia had given themselves breathing room  Scotland s Bazball Having been put in  it took Scotland a couple of overs to size up conditions and midway through the third they were still to reach double figures  That changed when McMullen lofted Nathan Ellis stylishly over long off  Even better was to follow as he used his feet against Mitchell Starc and flayed him into the stands over cover  When Adam Zampa was introduced he showed excellent

hasn t been able to get much game time  as much as he d probably like just getting that opportunity in the middle to be able to put that into place  for Mitch to be able to navigate what it s like with a number of spinners in the team   Australia ended up using 12 overs of spin with Agar  Maxwell and Zampa all bowling their full complement  They will be back in St Lucia to face India in their final Super Eight fixture  For a while it appeared Scotland would be joining them but that proved agonisingly out of reach ,Stoinis breaks Scotland hearts  England through to Super Eight  Scotland came close to making history  but the power and depth in Australia s batting ultimately proved to be too much ,Scotland could almost touch a history making moment  Australia s asking rate was approaching 13 going into the final seven overs of their chase in what  until then  had been an underwhelming performance  But Marcus Stoinis  with help from Travis Head and later Tim David  shattered their dreams and in turn left England breathing a sigh of relief in Antigua  the result securing their Super Eight berth in the T20 World Cup 2024  Stoinis  who mixed deftness and power in another impressive performance in what is becoming an outstanding tournament for him  put it back in Australia s favour with a 25 ball half century while Head turned on the afterburners after compiling a somewhat sedate 45 ball fifty with three sixes off consecutive legitimate deliveries  Although both departed  Australia entered the last over needing just five but there was one final twist  With three needed off four balls  David was dropped at deep midwicket by Chris Sole and with that went Scotland s last hope  The next ball was sent into the stands  For three quarters of the contest  Scotland had been outstanding  Their platform was laid by a blistering display from Brandon McMullen on one of the better batting surfaces of the tournament so far  Australia  who shelled six chances in a poor fielding display  clawed it back in the second 10 overs but in their powerplay were held to 36 for 2 by some excellent bowling  However  ultimately the depth and power of their batting order was too much leaving a host of emotions across two islands  Deftness and power from Stoinis Australia could not get up or ahead of the asking rate through the first half of the innings  When Glenn Maxwell  who had struck one six over long on  was defeated by a wonderful delivery from Mark Watt  which pitched on off stump and straightened  Scotland were buoyant and there was a sense that Australia could pay for being off the pace  However  Stoinis got away from his first ball with the help of a misfield  square cutting one of Watt s 24 yard deliveries  So often known for sheer brute force  he then deftly reverse swept Michael Leask from the first delivery of the next over and looked on his game  Still  the requirement had become a demanding 87 off 39 balls when Stoinis took down Leask with a reverse hit six over point then another down the ground  When Head slammed three sixes off Safyaan Sharif the tide had firmly turned  at one stage a series of 12 legitimate deliveries brought 46 runs  Sharif did strike back to have Head taken at long off  but Australia had given themselves breathing room  Scotland s Bazball Having been put in  it took Scotland a couple of overs to size up conditions and midway through the third they were still to reach double figures  That changed when McMullen lofted Nathan Ellis stylishly over long off  Even better was to follow as he used his feet against Mitchell Starc and flayed him into the stands over cover  When Adam Zampa was introduced he showed excellent footwork to send him for six  then drive through the off side against a shorter delivery  with another brace of sixes coming off Ashton Agar in the eighth over as he brought up a 26 ball fifty  At the other end  George Munsey had laboured somewhat to 4 off 10 balls but

24.txt,It was heartbreak for Nepal and their fans in Kingstown  as they fell short by only one run against South Africa in a nail biting encounter  Fans and players alike were in tears since the result also eliminated Nepal from Super Eight contention at the T20 World Cup 2024  South Africa made a clean sweep of the group stage with four wins in four  riding on Tabraiz Shamsi s 4 for 19 that dragged them back with a stunning 18th over  But for so very long  the game seemed Nepal s to lose  Their spinners had spun a web to limit South Africa to a subpar 115 for 7   even on a difficult  turning track   and then with the bat had brought the equation down to 25 needed off 30 balls  with seven wickets in hand  Shamsi though  in for Keshav Maharaj  turned the game with a double wicket 18th over  including that of the set Aasif Sheikh  42 off 49   The dots that followed raised the required rate  but two powerful late strikes from Sompal Kami and 18 year old Gulsan Jha took the game down to two off two balls  But Ottneil Baartman bowled two dots as Nepal failed to get bat on the ball both times  and a desperate attempt at a last gasp run left them inches short in the end  SA s overly cautious start Possibly scarred by their earlier outings in the tournament  South Africa began the game a touch too cautiously  and in the process batted conservatively when conditions for batting were at their best  While their 38 for 1 in the powerplay was their best of the tournament  South Africa were guilty of waiting for loose deliveries instead of putting the bowlers off their lines early on  Nepal for their part  rarely strayed in their lines and lengths and once the spinners took hold  they never looked back  Nepal spinners make SA crumble Sandeep Lamichhane s first delivery spat 6 2 degrees as it gripped and turned past Reeza Hendricks  defence  and that set the tone as South Africa rarely looked comfortable against the turning ball from that point on  While Lamichhane would end wicketless  his probing spell went for just 18 runs in his first outing of the tournament in Nepal s first game outside the USA  But in Dipendra Singh Airee  3 for 21  and Kushal Bhurtel  4 for 19   Nepal had enough overs of spin to exploit the conditions  with the pair accounting for all seven South African wickets  South Africa did their best to negotiate the conditions with a steady approach  but despite run a ball stands of 22 and 46 for the first two wickets  they struggled to up their gears  Only Tristan Stubbs  who scored 27 in 18 balls from No  8  scored at a strike

20th over to give SA a stirring come from behind win ,It was heartbreak for Nepal and their fans in Kingstown  as they fell short by only one run against South Africa in a nail biting encounter  Fans and players alike were in tears since the result also eliminated Nepal from Super Eight contention at the T20 World Cup 2024  South Africa made a clean sweep of the group stage with four wins in four  riding on Tabraiz Shamsi s 4 for 19 that dragged them back with a stunning 18th over  But for so very long  the game seemed Nepal s to lose  Their spinners had spun a web to limit South Africa to a subpar 115 for 7   even on a difficult  turning track   and then with the bat had brought the equation down to 25 needed off 30 balls  with seven wickets in hand  Shamsi though  in for Keshav Maharaj  turned the game with a double wicket 18th over  including that of the set Aasif Sheikh  42 off 49   The dots that followed raised the required rate  but two powerful late strikes from Sompal Kami and

them inches short in the end  SA s overly cautious start Possibly scarred by their earlier outings in the tournament  South Africa began the game a touch too cautiously  and in the process batted conservatively when conditions for batting were at their best  While their 38 for 1 in the powerplay was their best of the tournament  South Africa were guilty of waiting for loose deliveries instead of putting the bowlers off their lines early on  Nepal for their part  rarely strayed in their lines and lengths and once the spinners took hold  they never looked back  Nepal spinners make SA crumble Sandeep Lamichhane s first delivery spat 6 2 degrees as it gripped and turned past Reeza Hendricks  defence  and that set the tone as South Africa rarely looked comfortable against the turning ball from that point on  While Lamichhane would end wicketless  his probing spell went for just 18 runs in his first outing of the tournament in Nepal s first game outside the USA  But in Dipendra Singh Airee  3 for 21  and Kushal Bhurtel  4 for 19   Nepal had enough overs of spin to exploit the conditions  with the pair accounting for all seven South African wickets  South Africa did their best to negotiate the conditions with a steady approach  but despite run a ball stands of 22 and 46 for the first two wickets  they struggled to up their gears  Only Tristan Stubbs  who scored 27 in 18 balls

close to a decade  It was a welcome return to form for Shakib Al Hasan  who scored his first fifty in 20 T20I innings to shepherd Bangladesh to 159 for 5  Netherlands made a good fist of the chase  moving to 111 for 3 in the 15th over  But legspinner Rishad Hossain struck three times in four balls spread across two overs to change the course of the game  With Shakib and Mustafizur Rahman tightening the screws alongside Rishad  Netherlands fell in a heap  losing 4 for 6 in the space of 16 balls  They still had an outside chance with 36 needed off the last two overs  but Mustafizur Rahman s cutters proved too much to handle in the 19th over  He kept slanting the ball across  and the batters kept swishing and missing  He conceded just three runs in that over  having given away just one in the 17th  and Netherlands were eventually restricted to 134 for 8  Bangladesh fly away despite Dutt s strikes With the Bangladesh top order studded with left handers  Netherlands brought Aryan Dutt in for his first game of the tournament and he immediately repaid their faith  Introduced in the second over  he removed the Bangladesh captain with his second ball  It was an innocuous length ball outside off  which Najmul Hossain Shanto reverse swept straight to first slip  Dutt struck again in his next over  with a lot of help from Sybrand Engelbrecht  Litton Das eyed a slog sweep only to get a top edge well in front of square  But Engelbrecht  stationed behind square  sprinted to his left   put out a full length dive and picked up a screamer inches off the turf  Despite the early losses  Bangladesh continued to score at a fair clip  Tanzid Hasan struck Vivian Kingma for two fours and a six in the third over before Shakib picked another four off Paul van Meekeren in the fifth  Shakib then laid into Logan van Beek in the sixth over  smashing him for four fours to take Bangladesh to 54 for 2  comfortably their highest powerplay score of the tournament  The middle overs squeeze Netherlands weren t backing down  though  Captain Scott Edwards rung in the changes and the bowlers made sure to stick to their lengths  According to ESPNcricinfo s logs  Netherlands only veered into the full lengths four times in 10 overs from the seventh to the 16th  and Bangladesh s scoring rate dropped  The pressure told on Tanzid  who mistimed a pull to deep backward square leg in the ninth over  while Towhid Hridoy had his leg stump flattened by Tim Pringle in the 13th  Bangladesh managed only 58 runs in the middle ten overs with five fours and a six  and lost two wickets  Shakib the glue as Bangladesh end strongly The last time Shakib scored a fifty in T20Is was in October 2022 against Pakistan  At the T20 World Cup  he hadn t breached the half century mark since 2016  But on this crucial day  Bangladesh s stalwart stood tall  He scored his first seven runs at a run a ball  and picked up his once he got the hang of the surface  And even when the runs dried up in the middle phase  he kept rotating strike without panicking  He reached his fifty off 38 balls and hit de Leede for back to back fours in the final over to finish unbeaten on 64 off 46 balls  his innings studded with nine fours  There were important contributions from Mahmudullah  25 off 21  and Jaker Ali  14  off seven  as Bangladesh collected 47 runs off the last four overs  Bangladesh keep chipping away With 349 runs in nine innings  Michael Levitt came into this tournament as Netherlands  highest run scorer in T20Is since the start of 2024  However  he s had a dismal start to his T20 World Cup with scores of 1 and 0 against Nepal and South Africa  He seemed to change the tide against Bangladesh when he drove Mustafizur through the covers in the first over  Then  when he smashed Taskin Ahmed over the roof at deep midwicket  it seemed his campaign was back on track  But Levitt s joy was short lived  In the fifth over  he top edged a cut off Taskin to Hridoy at point  In the next over  Max O Dowd smashed a length ball straight back to Tanzim Hasan  and Netherlands ended the powerplay at 36 for 2  Vikramjit Singh hit Shakib for back to back sixes in the seventh over and slog swept Rishad over deep midwicket in the ninth  His sprightly 16 ball knock was cut short when he was stumped  walking past a tossed up delivery from Mahmudullah  But at 69 for 3 in the tenth over  Netherlands were still in with a chance  Rishad triple strike gives Bangladesh the W Netherlands seemed to be giving Bangladesh a proper fight when Engelbrecht and Edwards were at the crease  The duo ran superbly and got the boundaries at regular intervals during a 31 ball stand of 42 for the fourth wicket  When Rishad was brought on to bowl the 15th over  Netherlands required 56 off 36  The legspinner s first two overs had gone for 19 and he knew this over could decide the match  It did  in Bangladesh s favour  With his fourth ball  he got Engelbrecht to top edge a legbreak straight up  with Tanzim taking the catch at point  Two balls later  he had de Leede stumped with a ball that spun sharply past his outside edge  Mustafizur then got into the act by taking out Edwards  and when Rishad sent back Logan van Beek at the start of the 18th over  the game was as good as done  Dutt struck a six off Rishad later in that over  but he and Pringle had no answers to Mustafizur s cutters in the 19th  Eventually  Netherlands fell well short of their target  The result does not knock them out of contention  nor does it give Bangladesh a sure shot place in the Super Eight  It has  however  knocked Sri Lanka out  and given Bangladesh an excellent chance of advancing from Group D ,Shakib  Rishad and Mustafizur take Bangladesh one step closer to Super Eight  Thanks to this result  Sri Lanka are out of

29.txt,A sensational rescue effort from Sherfane Rutherford set up a third win on the trot for West Indies in the T20 World Cup 2024 while putting New Zealand on the verge of elimination at the Brian Lara stadium in Tarouba  With the win  the co hosts have also secured a spot in the Super Eight  New Zealand s fast bowlers dictated proceedings in the powerplay to have West Indies four down in the first innings  Rutherford found little support as West Indies slid to 112 for 9 after 18 overs  but he plundered 37 runs off the last two overs to take the co hosts to 149  Alzarri Joseph  Gudakesh Motie and Akeal Hosein then stepped up with the ball  as New Zealand slumped to their second defeat in as many games  Rutherford stands tall at the death Rutherford found himself in unfamiliar territory thanks to West Indies  top order collapse  coming in to bat in the sixth over  Only for the second time in his T20I career  he faced a ball in the powerplay  But he vied his time in his partnerships with Hosein  Andre Russell and Romario Shepherd  For long  his only two boundary shots were two sixes off drag downs from Mitchell Santner and James Neesham before he finally let loose in the last two overs  New Zealand took a gambit in using up their best frontline bowlers early and ended up giving Daryl Mitchell the penultimate over and Santner the last  The plan nearly paid off  with West Indies having just one wicket in hand after the 18th over  But Rutherford resisted as he first tore into Mitchell  hitting him for back to back sixes down the V  before depositing the ball over the fine leg fence for a third six in the over  He then hit Santner for two fours and a majestic six slog swept from wide of off over wide long on  on the way to a 33 ball half century  The 37 runs off the last two overs helped take West Indies to 149  a score that seemed unattainable for almost all of their innings  Allen attacks in the powerplay Finn Allen helped New Zealand gain early momentum in the chase  despite losing Devon Conway in the third over  Allen got going by pulling Shepherd behind square for a boundary in the second over before hoisting Hosein over cow corner  Hosein then had Conway caught at fine leg as he top edged while trying to sweep  done in by the extra bounce  Allen then flicked Russell behind square and cut Hosein for two more fours  Joseph  introduced in the sixth over  drew a leading edge off him only for Rutherford to drop him running back from point  But one ball later  Allen miscued a pull to Russell at deep square leg  Motie ties New Zealand down Motie struck in his first over  getting Williamson to nick behind trying to cut  as West Indies grabbed two wickets in two overs  In his next over  he had Rachin Ravindra   who came in to bat at No  3   hole out to deep midwicket  In his third over  Motie knocked Mitchell over with a peach that pitched on middle and spun past the outside edge to crash into the stumps  Between Motie and Hosein  West Indies  left arm spinners had combined figures of 4 for 46 from their eight overs  while offspinner Roston Chase bowled a four run over  Joseph stops Phillips  charge The spin choke saw New Zealand s asking rate swell When Neesham fell to Joseph  New Zealand needed 65 off 29 deliveries  Phillips then tried to force the issue  hitting Russell for a four and a six before pulling Joseph for back to back boundaries in the 18th over  However  Joseph had the last laugh as Phillips tried to pull again and skied a catch to long on running in  Joseph then had Southee caught off his own bowling to finish with a four wicket haul  effectively sealing the win for West Indies  Boult triggers WI s top order collapse At the start of the game  it was Trent Boult who made heads turn early  After asking West Indies to bat  New Zealand got a first over breakthrough courtesy Boult s wicket of Johnson Charles  who chopped one onto his stumps  Nicholas Pooran walked out to loud applause  and it took him three balls to get West Indies  first boundary with a leading edge past short third  The boundary also took Pooran past Chris Gayle to become the leading run scorer for West Indies in men s T20Is  Then followed a game of cat and mouse between Pooran and Tim Southee  who was among three changes New Zealand made from the side that lost to Afghanistan last week  In a sequence of four balls  Pooran hit two fours  was dropped by Mitchell between the two boundary shots and then fell to the seamer  Pooran tried to take Southee on for a third boundary in the over as the bowler dug in a short ball but skied it to wicketkeeper Conway running behind a swirling ball  Pooran was the first of four wickets that West Indies lost in the space of ten runs  Chase fell for a duck  miscuing Lockie Ferguson  and Southee had Rovman Powell edging behind  From 20 for 1  they were soon 30 for 5  when Brandon King departed in the seventh over  The Boult v Russell battle Then came a 28 run stand for the sixth wicket between Akeal Hosein and Rutherford that briefly stabilised their innings  A sharp catch by Neesham at midwicket off Santner s bowling ended Hosein s stay  and Russell came at No  8  Russell was immediately on the front foot  hitting Ferguson for two fours and a six  Williamson brought Boult back in the next over  the 13th of the innings  and the move paid off as Russell first missed an attempted hoick across the line and then top edged a catch to short third  Ferguson and Boult then dismissed Shepherd and Joseph with deliveries that stayed low  nd with two overs to go  New Zealand were the happier side  But they were not prepared for Rutherford to single handedly change the game s course and handed West Indies the momentum at the break  helped also by the energy of a packed

who could not put a foot wrong until then was human  after all  Netravalkar s dream beginning Virat Kohli first  Rohit Sharma next  The ball that felled Kohli in the first over was a dream delivery  The batter nicking off with a perfect away going delivery that had him jabbing  It was only Kohli s second golden duck in T20Is  The ball that got Rohit was somewhat similar  Except it was a lot closer to the stumps and had Rohit turning the face of the bat to take the leading edge  At mid off  Harmeet Singh  Rohit s school junior by a few years  ran back and held on  India were shell shocked at 15 for 2  which soon became 44 for 3 when Rishabh Pant was out to one that skidded low and through his defence  Suryakumar  Dube dig in to allay nerves It was almost as if the reprieve of Suryakumar deflated USA  Suddenly  Aaron Jones was switching fields every ball  running up to have a chat between deliveries  all of it playing into the hands of the batters  Twice  USA were warned about delaying the game by not beginning their next over within their 60 second allowance  When they erred for a third time  the umpires awarded five penalty runs to India  From 35 off 30  India now needed a run a ball 30  It didn t matter then that Dube had at one point been struggling on 5 off 14  or that Suryakumar was far from his 360 degree mode  In the 17th over  India truly broke the stranglehold when Suryakumar picked Shadley van Schalkwyk s medium pace for a lofted six over extra cover and a trademark flick over his shoulder for four off back to back deliveries  Off the first ball of the 19th  he got to a 49 ball half century  The winning runs were hit one legitimate delivery later when Dube dug out a yorker length delivery to long off  It could have so easily been another knock that had Dube s self doubts spiralling  but that he dug in to remain unbeaten on 31 in what was a hard scrap should give him lot of confidence  Arshdeep s career best has USA hobbling The day began with a two wicket opening over in which Arshdeep Singh swung the ball back in  Shayan Jahangir  replacing Monank Patel  was out lbw  and Andries Gous picked out mid off attempting to pull a skiddy short ball  It wasn t until Nitish Kumar and Corey Anderson added 25 off 18 heading into the final overs that USA had some injection of momentum that gave them a chance of getting towards 120  However  overs 16 18 scuppered those plans  Hardik bowled a wicket maiden in the 17th  dismissing Anderson for his second wicket  and Arshdeep had Harmeet Singh   who had top edged Bumrah for a six to get off the mark   caught behind  USA ended up with 110  which they d look back at and wonder what could ve been had they only got 10 more ,Suryakumar and Arshdeep the architects of hard fought India

take the leading edge  At mid off  Harmeet Singh  Rohit s school junior by a few years  ran back and held on  India were shell shocked at 15 for 2  which soon became 44 for 3 when Rishabh Pant was out to one that skidded low and through his defence  Suryakumar  Dube dig in to allay nerves It was almost as if the reprieve of Suryakumar deflated USA  Suddenly  Aaron Jones was switching fields every ball  running up to have a chat between deliveries  all of it playing into the hands of the batters  Twice  USA were warned about delaying the game by not beginning their next over within their 60 second allowance  When they erred for a third time  the umpires awarded five penalty runs to India  From 35 off 30  India now needed a run a ball 30  It didn t matter then that Dube had at one point been struggling on 5 off 14  or that Suryakumar was far from his 360 degree mode  In the 17th over  India truly broke the stranglehold when Suryakumar picked Shadley van Schalkwyk s medium pace for a lofted six over extra cover and a trademark flick over his shoulder for four off back to back deliveries  Off the first ball of the 19th  he got to a 49 ball half century  The winning runs were hit one legitimate delivery later when Dube dug out a yorker length delivery to long off  It could have so easily been another knock that had Dube s self doubts spiralling  but that he dug in to remain unbeaten on 31 in what was a hard scrap should give him lot of confidence  Arshdeep s career best has USA hobbling The day began with a two wicket opening over in which Arshdeep Singh swung the ball back in  Shayan Jahangir  replacing Monank Patel  was out lbw  and Andries Gous picked out mid off attempting to pull a skiddy short ball  It wasn t until Nitish Kumar and Corey Anderson added 25 off 18 heading into the final overs that USA had some injection of momentum that gave them a chance of getting towards 120  However  overs 16 18 scuppered those plans  Hardik bowled a wicket maiden in the 17th  dismissing Anderson for his second wicket  and Arshdeep had Harmeet Singh   who had top edged Bumrah for a six to get off the mark   caught behind  USA ended up with 110  which they d look back at and wonder what could ve been had they only got 10 more ,Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma both dismissed by Saurabh Netravalkar and India 15 for 2 in chase of 111. Suryakumar Yadav helped along by Shivam Dube during the course of a half century stand that proved to be a game changer. India are now through to the Super Eights but USA are still very much masters of their own fate.,0.07373271889400922,0.020785219399538105,0.04608294930875576,0.43999999999999995,0.14285714285714288,0.25999999999999995,0.8178810823257378,9.523541954426454,0.9841,0.031000000000000007,0.3506,0.04

34.txt,South Africa survived an almighty scare to to maintain a 100  win record at the T20 World Cup 2024  and in New York  where they chose to bat first in their final fixture at Eisenhower Park  On a used wicket  Aiden Markram decided to put a total on the board  and it almost looked like a mistake  South Africa were 23 for 4  but a record 79 run fifth wicket stand between Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller took them to 113  which they scrapped hard to defend  Bangladesh s start was not ideal  They were 50 for 4 after ten overs  but Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah put on 44 for the fifth wicket and got them back on track  They almost also got them over the line and will look back on one incident which could have forced a Super Over  In the 17th over  Mahmudullah missed a flick off Ottneil Baartman  which hit his front pad and deflected to the boundary for what looked like four leg byes  But he was given out off that ball  which made it dead at the point of impact  and reviewed the decision  Ball tracking showed Mahmudullah was not out  but because he had been given out  the four runs did not count  as outlined by the ICC s protocols on DRS  3 7 1  in the playing conditions for T20Is  In the end  Bangladesh fell short by four runs  That  and their inability to capitalise on Keshav Maharaj bowling the final over for the first time in T20Is and sending down three full tosses  cost them the game  Maharaj was tasked with the final over after Markram bowled the seamers out earlier  It seemed a miscalculation  but he got two wickets as Bangladesh sought to clear the boundary though neither Jaker Ali nor Mahmudullah could  Mahmudullah was out on the penultimate ball   off a full toss   to a well timed running catch by Markram from long on  which all but ended Bangladesh s hopes  South Africa leave the USA with three wins from three matches  and will move to St  Vincent to play Nepal in their last group match  They are in pole position to qualify for the Super 8s  Bangladesh also head to the West Indies  and will play Netherlands and Nepal  with the Super 8s still in sight  Top three troubles For all the talk about the power of their batting line up  South Africa s top three have underperformed thus far  albeit on tough batting surfaces  Collectively  Quinton de Kock  Reeza Hendricks and Markram have scored 61 runs in nine trips to the crease at an average of 6 77  Of teams that have played at least two matches at the tournament  only Uganda and PNG average lower  The biggest concern will be Hendricks  whose scores of 4  3 and 0 are the lowest of the trio  and whose methods of dismissal appear to show a technical deficiency  Twice in two games  Hendricks has been stuck in his crease and then played down the wrong line  He ll be looking over his shoulder knowing fellow opener Ryan Rickelton is waiting on the bench  and could get an opportunity in the next match  Things got even worse when Tristan Stubbs was dismissed for a duck in the fifth over  South Africa have only lost their first four wickets by end of the fifth over on five occasions in men s T20Is  and two of them came in this competition  Happily for them  they had Klaasen and Miller on hand to shore up the mid section of the innings  Three overs  13 runs After Tanzim Hasan  3 for 18  set the tone with wickets upfront  Taskin Ahmed took charge of the latter stages  helped by Rishad Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman  Between them  the trio gave away just 13 runs in the last three overs of South Africa s innings  and removed both danger batters Klaasen and Miller in a clutch display of death bowling  Klaasen was dismissed halfway through the 18th over  when he slogged across the line but was early on his shot  and the low bounce took the ball onto leg stump  Taskin only conceded three singles off the rest of that over to finish with 2 for 19 from his four overs  It may have been a gamble to use legspinner Rishad for the penultimate over  especially when his previous three cost 28 runs  but he knocked Miller out with a topspinner second ball  and Maharaj could not get him away  Rishad s final over cost just four  Then came the Fizz  who took the ball away from Maharaj for four consecutive dots before a fifth went wide and was called as such  The batters scored three runs off the last two balls and were frustrated by their inability to score any boundaries in the last three overs  Happy Birthday David Miller On his 35th birthday  Miller was given a gift when he edged the first ball Mahmudullah bowled  But Litton Das  who was standing up to the stumps  was unable to react quickly enough to take the catch  Miller was on 13 at the time and went on to more than double his score and finish on 29  But that wasn t the end of the presents for him  He was stationed at extra cover when Maharaj was brought on to bowl the first over after the powerplay  and Litton  not content with what he had already given Miller  slapped the ball straight to him  Miller made no mistake  and Bangladesh were 29 for 2 in the seventh over  Three overs  15 runs Bangladesh had to get 20 runs off the last 18 balls  and after putting on the squeeze in that period would have expected it to be difficult but perhaps not this difficult  Kagiso Rabada bowled the 18th over  despite not being his best at the tournament so far  He only half appealed when Hridoy missed an attempted clip to the leg side but was rewarded with a wicket first up  Rabada went on to concede only one more run in an over of hard lengths  Then Baartman stepped up for the 19th  and stuck to a slightly fuller length which neither Mahmudullah nor Jaker could get away  He conceded seven runs  The test was when Maharaj  who has never done this job before  was left with the final six balls  He started with a wide  His second legal ball was a low full toss that Mahmudullah hit hard down the ground  but the slow outfield stopped it from getting to the rope  Jaker tried to send the next one over the rope but couldn t clear long on  and then Rishad managed a leg bye  But the last two balls were both full tosses that should have been dispatched over the rope  However  Mahmdullah s effort found Markram  while Taskin could only hit the final ball to cover to give South Africa a nervy anti choke win ,Bangladesh fall short as SA conjure a win from nowhere  Klaasen  Miller  Maharaj and Rabada all had a hand in helping them win by four runs ,South Africa survived an almighty scare to to maintain a 100  win record at the T20 World Cup 2024  and in New York  where they chose to bat first in their final fixture at Eisenhower Park  On a used wicket  Aiden Markram decided to put a total on the board  and it almost looked like a mistake  South Africa were 23 for 4  but a record 79 run fifth wicket stand between Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller took them to 113  which they scrapped hard to defend  Bangladesh s start was not ideal  They were 50 for 4 after ten overs  but Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah put on 44 for the fifth wicket and got them back on track  They almost also got them over the line and will look back on one incident which could have forced a Super Over  In the 17th over  Mahmudullah missed a flick off Ottneil Baartman  which hit his front pad and deflected to the boundary for what looked like four leg byes  But he was given out off that ball  which made it dead at the point of impact  and reviewed the decision  Ball tracking showed Mahmudullah was not out  but because he had been given out  the four runs did not count  as outlined by the ICC s protocols on DRS  3 7 1  in the playing conditions for T20Is  In the end  Bangladesh fell short by four runs  That  and their inability to capitalise on Keshav Maharaj bowling the final over for the first time in T20Is and sending down three full tosses  cost them the game  Maharaj was tasked with the final over after Markram bowled the seamers out earlier  It seemed a miscalculation  but he got two wickets as Bangladesh sought to clear the boundary though neither Jaker Ali nor Mahmudullah could  Mahmudullah was out on the penultimate ball   off a full toss   to a well timed running catch by Markram from long on  which all but ended Bangladesh s hopes  South Africa leave the USA with three wins from three matches  and will move to St  Vincent to play Nepal in their last group match  They are in pole position to qualify for the Super 8s  Bangladesh also head to the West Indies  and will play Netherlands and Nepal  with the Super 8s still in sight  Top three troubles For all the talk about the power of their batting line up  South Africa s top three have underperformed thus far  albeit on tough batting surfaces  Collectively  Quinton de Kock  Reeza Hendricks and Markram have scored 61 runs in nine trips to the crease at an average of 6 77  Of teams that have played at least two matches at the tournament  only Uganda and PNG average lower  The biggest concern will be Hendricks  whose scores of 4  3 and 0 are the lowest of the trio  and whose methods of dismissal appear to show a technical deficiency  Twice in two games  Hendricks has been stuck in his crease and then played down the wrong line  He ll be looking over his shoulder knowing fellow opener Ryan Rickelton is waiting on the bench  and could get an opportunity in the next match  Things got even worse when Tristan Stubbs was dismissed for a duck in the fifth over  South Africa have only lost their first four wickets by end of the fifth over on five occasions in men s T20Is  and two of them came in this competition  Happily for them  they had Klaasen and Miller on hand to shore up the mid section of the innings  Three overs  13 runs After Tanzim Hasan  3 for 18  set the tone with wickets upfront  Taskin Ahmed took charge of the latter stages  helped by Rishad Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman  Between them  the trio gave away just 13 runs in the last three overs of South Africa s innings  and removed both danger batters Klaasen and Miller in a clutch display of death bowling  Klaasen was dismissed halfway through the 18th over  when he slogged across the line but was early on his shot  and the low bounce took the ball onto leg stump  Taskin only conceded three singles off the rest of that over to finish with 2 for 19 from his four overs  It may have been a gamble to use legspinner Rishad for the penultimate over  especially when his previous three cost 28 runs  but he knocked Miller out with a topspinner second ball  and Maharaj could not get him away  Rishad s final over cost just four  Then came the Fizz  who took the ball away from Maharaj for four consecutive dots before a fifth went wide and was called as such  The batters scored three runs off the last two balls and were frustrated by their inability to score any boundaries in the last three overs  Happy Birthday David Miller On his 35th birthday  Miller was given a gift when he edged the first ball Mahmudullah bowled  But Litton Das  who was standing up to the stumps  was unable to react quickly enough to take the catch  Miller was on 13 at the time and went on to more than double his score and finish on 29  But that wasn t the end of the presents for him  He was stationed at extra cover when Maharaj was brought on to bowl the first over after the powerplay  and Litton  not content with what he had already given Miller  slapped the ball straight to him  Miller made no mistake  and Bangladesh were 29 for 2 in the seventh over  Three overs  15 runs Bangladesh had to get 20 runs off the last 18 balls  and after putting on the squeeze in that period would have expected it to be difficult but perhaps not this difficult  Kagiso Rabada bowled the 18th over  despite not being his best at the tournament so far  He only half appealed when Hridoy missed an attempted clip to the leg side but was rewarded with a wicket first up  Rabada went on to concede only one more run in an over of hard lengths  Then Baartman stepped up for the 19th  and stuck to a slightly fuller length which neither Mahmudullah nor Jaker could get away  He conceded seven runs  The test was when Maharaj  who has never done this job before  was left with the final six balls  He started with a wide  His second legal ball was a low full toss that Mahmudullah hit hard down the ground  but the slow outfield stopped it from getting to the rope  Jaker tried to send the next one over the rope but couldn t clear long on  and then Rishad managed a leg bye  But the last two balls were both full tosses that should have been dispatched over the rope  However  Mahmdullah s effort found Markram  while Taskin could only hit the final ball to cover to give South Africa a nervy anti choke win ,South Africa survived an almighty scare to maintain a 100  win record at the T20 World Cup 2024. Aiden Markram decided to put a total on the board  and it almost looked like a mistake. A record 79 run fifth wicket stand between Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller took them to 113. Bangladesh fell short by four runs and their inability to capitalise on Keshav Maharaj bowling the final over cost them the game.

over World Cup was the ultimate humiliation  they might have to ready themselves for even greater discomfort  even closer to home  That s the upshot of a rousing Scotland run chase against Oman in Antigua  which was ignited by a feisty knock of 41 from 20 balls by George Munsey  and sealed in a pointed hurry with 41 balls to spare  thanks to Brandon McMullen s combative 61 from 31  whose roar of triumph echoed around the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium as he dragged the winning boundary through square leg off Bilal Khan  It was Scotland s second victory to go alongside the pivotal wash out against England that set the tone for each team s campaign  and it has placed their progression firmly in their own hands  Even a narrow loss to Australia could yet be enough  if England are unable to instigate a near four point swing in net run rate in their next two matches against Oman and Namibia  For Oman  three losses from three ends their own hopes  as well as England s chance to dictate the terms of their own progression in the manner that you d expect from defending world champions  Munsey ignites Scotland s chase In the final analysis  Scotland outmuscled Oman by 11 sixes to four  but it was two in particular   off consecutive balls in the seventh over of their chase   that ended any prospect of this being a tense tiptoe over the finish line  Munsey s superb command of the reverse sweep had been telegraphed in the England wash out  but when he twice launched Aqib Ilyas onto the grass banks at the left hander s backward point  Scotland turned on the afterburners  They hadn t exactly been sluggish in the powerplay  reaching 50 for 1 in six overs  with Michael Jones s 16 from 13 containing the first two sixes of their chase  but thereafter Oman had no means to restrict a free flowing line up  The final 103 runs of the chase were duly chewed up in just 43 balls  as Scotland s batters kept raining down the blows  safe in the knowledge that every man in the line up was primed to do likewise  Munsey fell one over after his bugle call blows  though not before slamming another sweep onto the grass in a 16 run over that also contained five leg side wides   an indication of the extent to which Oman had run out of places to hide  Their cause was not helped by another sloppy catching display from the most fallible team in the tournament  including a bad miss by Rafiullah at deep midwicket off McMullen  but in truth  such was the collective commitment to attack  it probably wouldn t have made much difference  This approach was epitomised by Scotland s captain  Richie Berrington  who belted Aqib for a six and a four  and was then beaten by consecutive googlies in the same over  the second of which bowled him for 13 from 7  But Matt Cross joined an increasingly free flowing McMullen to romp towards the line with consecutive sixes of his own  deposited over square leg as Ayaan Khan s only over was launched for 20  Oman take first use  to Scotland s delight On a fresh pitch  on a fresh island  it was something of a surprise that Oman chose to bat first after winning the toss   Berrington was perfectly happy with the chance to take stock and

lackadaisical moments   most notably Munsey s spill over the ropes at long on that allowed Athavale to reach his fifty from 38 balls  But then came a very revealing shot in anger  a huge leading edge from Naseem Khushi that hung in the breeze  kept three fielders in the hunt  yet sailed clean over the long boundary at extra cover  It was an indication of the riches on offer if teams hit with the wind and committed to their stroke  For some reason  Khushi decided to go in the diametrically opposite direction two balls later  and Mark Watt at short backward square snaffled a miscued ramp  But the lesson  it transpired  would not be lost on his opponents  Dead ball  Watt do you mean  Watt  arguably Scotland s key bowling weapon  had not been at his most incisive  or economical  in the Namibia victory  but this time he was right back into the thick of the action   for all manner of different reasons  After being thrown the ball at the top of the powerplay  Watt burgled his way

tactic  Kail pulled out of his stance on the first occasion  then did so again   apparently after Watt had informed the umpire he would be producing it again  This time the ball hit the stumps  but

40.txt,Nuwan Thushara s last over brought Sri Lanka screaming back into the match late in the contest  He first bowled Rishad Hossain  and then nailed Taskin Ahmed in front of the stumps with a pinpoint swinging yorker  This left Bangladesh eight wickets down  with 12 runs still to get  and the game looked set to turn on its head  However  the experienced Mahmudullah was at the crease for Bangladesh  and despite some further nervy moments  pushed his side across the line off the last ball of the 19th over to give his side victory in their opening encounter of T20 World Cup 2024  The late Sri Lanka surge aside  this was a match chiefly decided by Bangladesh s own outstanding bowling in the first innings  Mustafizur Rahman was the best among them  using shorter lengths and his cutters efficiently  to claim figures of 3 for 17  Rishad s three for through the middle overs also pegged Sri Lanka back  Mustafizur was especially instrumental in Sri Lanka s downward spiral through the middle overs  which culminated in a crash and burn end  Ultimately  Sri Lanka s inability to find boundaries  or even rotate strike against good Bangladesh bowling resulted in their downfall  A score of 125 for 9 always seemed poor on a decent pitch  even if their bowlers made a match of it in the end  The tight finish It should never have got so close  With five overs to go  Bangladesh had only 25 runs left to get  five wickets in hand  and their two most experienced batters   Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah   were at the crease  But then Shakib uppercut a Matheesha Pathirana short ball  and Maheesh Theekshana took an outstanding diving catch at deep third  surging in from the rope to intercept the ball inches from the ground  And then Sri Lanka s other slinger  Thushara  took two wickets in two balls in the next over   the 18th of the innings  first bowling Rishad who had tried to hit him inside out over cover  and then nailing Taskin with a toe crusher that would have hit leg stump  Thushara had three more balls left in the over  with Bangladesh still needing 12  Sri Lanka s best chance of stealing victory was for him to get another wicket before his spell ended  But Tanzim Hasan Sakib survived  and Mahmudullah was on strike next over  Next over  bowled by Dasun Shanaka  Sri Lanka had used up all their frontliners hunting for wickets   Mahmudullah bludgeoned a thigh high full toss into the deep square leg stands to ease Bangladesh s nerves  But there was more drama to come  With two runs needed   but desperate to keep strike off the last ball of the 19th over   Mahmudullah ventured a risky single to mid off  and would have been out had Wanindu Hasaranga connected with his shy at the stumps  But the Sri Lanka captain didn t  and the overthrows helped Bangladesh limp over the line  Bangladesh boss bowling death overs The definitive period of play  though  were the last seven overs of Sri Lanka s innings  They had arrived at the start of the 14th over in okay shape   100 runs on the board and seven wickets in hand  But then they nosedived  Rishad first dismissed Charith Asalanka  having him caught slog sweeping at deep square leg  after his teammates had kept Asalanka quiet through much of the middle overs  Next ball  he had Hasaranga caught at slip with a ball that dipped and gripped  This double strike pushed Sri Lanka into a tailspin  losing their next six wickets for 25 runs  Only one boundary would be hit in the last six overs  as batters repeatedly tried cross batted shots against bowlers varying their pace and got themselves out  almost in frustration  Rishad got his three wickets in this period  and Taskin  Mustafizur  and Tanzim Hasan got one each  Nissanka s bright start That Sri Lanka even got to 125  rather than crashing out in double figures as they did against South Africa  was down to their best batter   opener Pathum Nissanka  He struck seven fours and a six  favouring the leg side  and maintained a strike rate of 168 across his 28 ball innings  The turning point for Sri Lanka s innings  after which they struck only two intentional boundaries  seriously   was when Mustafizur dismissed Nissanka with a cutter towards the end of the ninth over  Until that point  Sri Lanka s run rate was above 7 50  Afterwards  it was less than five  Hridoy s sixes Given how close the match was in the end  Towhid Hridoy s four sixes   all of them against Hasaranga   also had an impact  Three of them came back to back to back  at the start of the 12th over  The first two came off slog sweeps  and the third off a beautiful inside out shot over cover  Hasaranga would trap him lbw next ball  but Hridoy had already landed the important blows  It was these sixes that gave Bangladesh the room to stutter towards the end and still win with two wickets in hand and one over to spare ,Mustafizur  Rishad  Hridoy dazzle in Bangladesh s tight two wicket win over Sri Lanka  Thushara s 4 for 18 made life difficult for Bangladesh  but Mahmudullah s experience saw them through ,Nuwan Thushara s last over brought Sri Lanka screaming back into the match late in the contest  He first bowled Rishad Hossain  and then nailed Taskin Ahmed in front of the stumps with a pinpoint swinging yorker  This left Bangladesh eight wickets down  with 12 runs still to get  and the game looked set to turn on its head  However  the experienced Mahmudullah was at the crease for Bangladesh  and despite some further nervy moments  pushed his side across the line off the last ball of the 19th over to give his side victory in their opening encounter of T20 World Cup 2024  The late Sri Lanka surge aside  this was a match chiefly decided by Bangladesh s own outstanding bowling in the first innings  Mustafizur Rahman was the best among them  using shorter lengths and his cutters efficiently  to claim figures of 3 for 17  Rishad s three for through the middle overs also pegged Sri Lanka back  Mustafizur was especially instrumental in Sri Lanka s downward spiral through the middle overs  which culminated in a crash and burn end  Ultimately  Sri Lanka s inability to find boundaries  or even rotate strike against good Bangladesh bowling resulted in their downfall  A score of 125 for 9 always seemed poor on a decent pitch  even if their bowlers made a match of it in the end  The tight finish It should never have got so close  With five overs to go  Bangladesh had only 25 runs left to get  five wickets in hand  and their two most experienced batters   Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah   were at the crease  But then Shakib uppercut a Matheesha Pathirana short ball  and Maheesh Theekshana took an outstanding diving catch at deep third  surging in from the rope to intercept the ball inches from the ground  And then Sri Lanka s other slinger  Thushara  took two wickets in two balls in the next over   the 18th of the innings  first bowling Rishad who had tried to hit him inside out over cover  and then nailing Taskin with a toe crusher that would have hit leg stump  Thushara had three more balls left in the over  with Bangladesh still needing 12  Sri Lanka s best chance of stealing victory was for him to get another wicket before his spell ended  But Tanzim Hasan Sakib survived  and Mahmudullah was on strike next over  Next over  bowled by Dasun Shanaka  Sri Lanka had used up all their frontliners hunting for wickets   Mahmudullah bludgeoned a thigh high full toss into the deep square leg stands to ease Bangladesh s nerves  But there was more drama to come  With two runs needed   but desperate to keep strike off the last ball of the 19th over   Mahmudullah ventured a risky single to mid off  and would have been out had Wanindu Hasaranga connected with his shy at the stumps  But the Sri Lanka captain didn t  and the overthrows helped Bangladesh limp over the line  Bangladesh boss bowling death overs The definitive period of play  though  were the last seven overs of Sri Lanka s innings  They had arrived at the start of the 14th over in okay shape   100 runs on the board and seven wickets in hand  But then they nosedived  Rishad first dismissed Charith Asalanka  having him caught slog sweeping at deep square leg  after his teammates had kept Asalanka quiet through much of the middle overs  Next ball  he had Hasaranga caught at slip with a ball that dipped and gripped  This double strike pushed Sri Lanka into a tailspin  losing their next six wickets for 25 runs  Only one boundary would be hit in the last six overs  as batters repeatedly tried cross batted shots against bowlers varying their pace and got themselves out  almost in frustration  Rishad got his three wickets in this period  and Taskin  Mustafizur  and Tanzim Hasan got one each  Nissanka s bright start That Sri Lanka even got to 125  rather than crashing out in double figures as they did against South Africa  was down to their best batter   opener Pathum Nissanka  He struck seven fours and a six  favouring the leg side  and maintained a strike rate of 168 across his 28 ball innings  The turning point for Sri Lanka s innings  after which they struck only two intentional boundaries  seriously   was when Mustafizur dismissed Nissanka with a cutter towards the end of the ninth over  Until that point  Sri Lanka s run rate was above 7 50  Afterwards  it was less than five  Hridoy s sixes Given how close the match was in the end  Towhid Hridoy s four sixes   all of them against Hasaranga   also had an impact  Three of them came back to back to back  at the start of the 12th over  The first two came off slog sweeps  and the third off a beautiful inside out shot over cover  Hasaranga would trap him lbw next ball  but Hridoy had already landed the important blows  It was these sixes that gave Bangladesh the room to stutter towards the end and still win with two wickets in hand and one over to spare ,Nuwan Thushara took two wickets in two balls in the next over to bring Sri Lanka back into the contest. Mahmudullah pushed his side across the line off the last ball of the 19th over to give his side victory.

This was the first time in five innings that a team had managed to breach the 100 run mark in New York this World Cup  And it proved to be enough  The Canada bowlers were all over the Ireland batters in the chase  They did not let them get away in the powerplay before Junaid Siddiqui and Saad Bin Zafar applied the squeeze in the middle overs  When Ireland slipped to 59 for 6 in the 13th over  it seemed all but over for them  Mark Adair and George Dockrell resurrected the Irish innings and put on 62 for the seventh wicket  but Jeremy Gordon and Dilon Heyliger held their own at the death to deliver Canada a famous win  Ireland were restricted to 125 for 7 and have now lost two in two  Gordon helps Canada take powerplay honours On an uneven surface and a sluggish outfield  a chase of 138 was always going to be a tricky ask  Canada s defence did not get off to the best of starts with Kaleem Sana unable to control the early movement  But Gordon understood the lengths to bowl on the surface from the get go and the rest of the bowlers followed suit  Ireland could only manage two fours in the first six overs   one in the first over and one in the sixth  In between  there were plenty of swishes and misses from Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie and hardly any decent connections  Gordon s relentless lengths got the better of Stirling in the final over of the powerplay when he could only manage a top edge on his attempted heave with the wicketkeeper taking a comfortable catch  He fell for an uncharacteristic 9 off 17 and Ireland s innings went downhill thereon  Ireland slip  slide and stumble It was complete Canadian domination in the next seven overs or so with Ireland unable to understand how to go about the chase  Saad and Siddiqui attacked the stumps  hardly giving the batters anything to work with  33 of the 48 balls they bowled finished on a wicket to wicket line  according to ESPNcricinfo s data  The surface seemed to slow up a touch in the second half and the two spinners made sure to take full toll  Balbirnie fell second ball after the powerplay  caught and bowled by Siddiqui  Saad struck next with a straight ball that breached Harry Tector s defences  Lorcan Tucker inexplicably ran himself out in the 10th over before Heyliger sent back Curtis Campher with a little help from Aaron Johnson  who took a lovely catch at deep backward square leg diving to his left  And when Gareth Delany fell in the 13th over with the Ireland score on 59  an early finish was on the cards  Adair  Dockrell give Ireland hope but Canada prevail With the equation reading 64 off 30 after 15 overs and only four wickets in hand  Ireland needed nothing short of a miracle to pull this off  Dockrell gave Ireland a chance when he bashed Siddiqui for a four and six in the 16th over before Adair produced a similar result against Sana in the next  Heyliger  however  kept his cool to only concede eight runs in the 18th over  Sana s 19th went for 11  which meant Gordon had 16 runs to defend in the final over  And he did it expertly  There were no full balls  only the hard length stuff and there was nothing Adair could do  He played and missed the first ball and top

it seemed like a good toss to win for Ireland with their bowlers finding movement and carry  Adair had Navneet Dhaliwal caught at backward point before Craig Young sent back Aaron Johnson  caught at

form of late  He had scored a fifty against Nepal in Canada s warm up game and another one against USA in the World Cup opener  And he started in a similar vein in New York  Alongside Movva  he first

43.txt,Scotland produced a stunning run chase to beat Namibia by five wickets in the T20 World Cup 2024  Returning to the Kensington Oval after their washout against England  they achieved a target of 156 with nine balls to spare  securing their first T20I victory over Namibia at the fourth attempt  A 74 run partnership between Richie Berrington and Michael Leask  ultimately  saw Scotland home  Berrington finished 47 not out after Leask injected impetus into the chase with a 17 ball 35  Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus had earlier turned matters in his side s favour with the ball  taking 2 for 29 after his 52 underpinned their 155 for 9 in the first innings  Erasmus  decision to win the toss and bat first on what has been an unpredictable Kensington Oval pitch was not immediately vindicated as Namibia found themselves 55 for 4  thanks largely to the excellence of the new ball pair of Brad Wheal and Brad Currie  But Erasmus put the Namibia innings on his back with his 11th fifty plus T20I score  37 of which came in a rebuilding stand of 51 with Zane Green for the fifth wicket  Despite losing George Munsey earlier in their chase  Scotland had chipped off 49 midway through the eighth over for the loss of just one  Michael Jones stepped up the gears  scoring 15 of the 18 runs in the final over of the powerplay  but Erasmus returned to the fray with to instigate a collapse  With his wily offspinners at one end  and Bernard Scholtz s slow left arm at the other  the pair pocketed three wickets between them as Scotland fell from 49 for 1 to 73 for 4 after 11 overs  It was at that point Leask joined forces with Berrington to take Scotland to the brink with a 42 ball partnership that included seven boundaries  including four sixes from Leask  Though he would fall  Berrington finished the match off in style  carting David Wiese into the pavilion at long on as Scotland triumphed to put them top of the group  Leask the beast How about that for a cameo  In just 17 balls  Leask turned this chase upside down and inside out  He arrived at a time when the boundaries had dried up  with Scotland requiring 80 from 50 deliveries  By the time he was done  that equation was 9 from 13  After playing out a dot ball first  he was never below a run a ball  and would score off all but one of his next 16  He was the ideal foil for Berrington  who  having been out there from the 10th over  was finally getting to grips with the pitch  Once Berrington had blown the horn on the boundary pursuit with a six and four off consecutive deliveries from Tangeni Lungameni  Leask took the lead  Erasmus was the first to get it  heaved to midwicket for the first of Leask s four sixes  Then came the killer  a 17th over that went for 19  David Wiese  the hero of Namibia s Super Over victory over Oman  was treated with disdain  sent over the sponge at cow corner twice by Leask   strikes which sandwiched a Berrington four in the same region  Leask s final six was his biggest of the lot   reading a slower ball from Ruben Trumpelmann and sending it back with interest over to the leg side for all of 101 meters  The scale of the strike was more than its distance as it took Scotland s ask to under a run a ball for the first time in the innings  Spin shocks Jocks After Michael Jones had blitzed the sixth over  Erasmus decided to take pace off  Together with Scholtz  they set about pinning Scotland s middle order down  Erasmus operated exclusively around the wicket  darting his off breaks across the right handers  limiting their scoring by restricting their ability to swing straight  Jones  half hearted attempt to do so resulted in a caught behind  An absent minded Brandon McMullen was then stumped at the second attempt after dancing down the pitch and failing to reclaim his ground with his back foot  Scholtz was subsisting on a wicket to wicket line at the other end  a frugal tactic that saw him go for just one boundary  In a bid to break the shackles  Matthew Cross fell lbw attempting to sweep a ball that was a touch too short to sweep  It spoke of the panic Namibia had concocted at the time  After a Powerplay of 43 for 1  the next six overs had produced 35 for 3  Erasmus all round display in vain  It would be better if had come in a win   bristled Erasmus at the end of the match  He s right  of course  For the longest time  it looked like it would  Before his two wickets had tilted the chase Namibia s way  his 52 from 31 had made the game competitive  The knock was an anomaly in a stodgy batting effort where opener Nikolaas Davin was the only other Namibian top order batter to strike in excess of 120  Erasmus struck his second ball for six  and his third for four   both coming at the start of the sixth over  as Scotland tried to sneak six balls from Mark Watt in at the end of the powerplay  The point region was peppered throughout  likewise midwicket  for all of his seven boundaries  Who knows how long he could have gone on had he controlled his aggression instead of trying to blast Leask over his head after slog sweeping him for six the ball before  The strike saw him pass JJ Smit s record of 51 T20I sixes for Namibia  Had others stood up  he would have been a worthy Player of the Match  Currie does it for the medium pacers In a tournament where the out and out quicks are already dominating the column inches  Currie put in a display that showed there is glory to be had with mediums  The 25 year old has been doing that for a while  both domestically for Sussex and with Scotland  coming into this match with a T20I record of 19 dismissals and an economy rate of 4 94  Those numbers have now moved in different directions after 2 for 16 from his four overs  Currie had the ball on a string throughout  mixing up cutters and the odd cross seam delivery amongst his stock deliveries  The left armer s first two overs utilised the swing on offer with the new ball  assisted by Cross standing up to the stumps to keep Davin and Jan Frylinck honest  While Davin was able to impart his own pace on the ball to strike a four through backward point in the fourth over   the only boundary against Currie   Frylinck played on when attempting to do the same two balls earlier  He returned for the 11th over  before conceding just three runs off the 19th  in which he varied his lengths to prevent the lower order from hitting down the ground  Trumpelmann s attempt at a six into the wind gave Currie a well deserved second wicket ,Berrington and Leask launch Scotland to landmark victory  Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus put in a fine all round show but it wasn t enough ,Scotland produced a stunning run chase to beat Namibia by five wickets in the T20 World Cup 2024  Returning to the Kensington Oval after their washout against England  they achieved a target of 156 with nine balls to spare  securing their first T20I victory over Namibia at the fourth attempt  A 74 run partnership between Richie Berrington and Michael Leask  ultimately  saw Scotland home  Berrington finished 47 not out after Leask injected impetus into the chase with a 17 ball 35  Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus had earlier turned matters in his side s favour with the ball  taking 2 for 29 after his 52 underpinned their 155 for 9 in the first innings  Erasmus  decision to win the toss and bat first on what has been an unpredictable Kensington Oval pitch was not immediately vindicated as Namibia found themselves 55 for 4  thanks largely to the excellence of the new ball pair of Brad Wheal and Brad Currie  But Erasmus put the Namibia innings on his back with his 11th fifty plus T20I score  37 of which came in a rebuilding stand of 51 with Zane Green for the fifth wicket  Despite losing George Munsey earlier in their chase  Scotland had chipped off 49 midway through the eighth over for the loss of just one  Michael Jones stepped up the gears  scoring 15 of the 18 runs in the final over of the powerplay  but Erasmus returned to the fray with to instigate a collapse  With his wily offspinners at one end  and Bernard Scholtz s slow left arm at the other  the pair pocketed three wickets between them as Scotland fell from 49 for 1 to 73 for 4 after 11 overs  It was at that point Leask joined forces with Berrington to take Scotland to the brink with a 42 ball partnership that included seven boundaries  including four sixes from Leask  Though he would fall  Berrington finished the match off in style  carting David Wiese into the pavilion at long on as Scotland triumphed to put them top of the group  Leask the beast How about that for a cameo  In just 17 balls  Leask turned this chase upside down and inside out  He arrived at a time when the boundaries had dried up  with Scotland requiring 80 from 50 deliveries  By the time he was done  that equation was 9 from 13  After playing out a dot ball first  he was never below a run a ball  and would score off all but one of his next 16  He was the ideal foil for Berrington  who  having been out there from the 10th over  was finally getting to grips with the pitch  Once Berrington had blown the horn on the boundary pursuit with a six and four off consecutive deliveries from Tangeni Lungameni  Leask took the lead  Erasmus was the first to get it  heaved to midwicket for the first of Leask s four sixes  Then came the killer  a 17th over that went for 19  David Wiese  the hero of Namibia s Super Over victory over Oman  was treated with disdain  sent over the sponge at cow corner twice by Leask   strikes which sandwiched a Berrington four in the same region  Leask s final six was his biggest of the lot   reading a slower ball from Ruben Trumpelmann and sending it back with interest over to the leg side for all of 101 meters  The scale of the strike was more than its distance as it took Scotland s ask to under a run a ball for the first time in the innings  Spin shocks Jocks After Michael Jones had blitzed the sixth over  Erasmus

46.txt,A hard fought three wicket win on a challenging pitch gave Uganda their maiden win at the T20 World Cup  They beat Papua New Guinea  PNG  in a low scoring game in Guyana where both teams vied for their first win in the competition  PNG s batting crumbled to 77 all out after being put to bat  before Uganda  themselves in trouble at 26 for 5  reached home in the 19th over  Riazat Ali Shah  one of Uganda s rising stars  used a low backlift in his careful 33 off 56 to shepherd them through the tricky chase  falling just three runs shy of Uganda s target  PNG were left to rue their poor batting  but they also conceded 15 wides  the second biggest contribution on the scorecard  But the story of the evening was Uganda s bowling in the first innings  set up by the pair of 43 year old Frank Nsubuga and 21 year old Juma Miyagi  Both vindicated their inclusion in this game with superb spells  Nsubuga bowled the most economical spell  minimum four overs  in T20 World Cup history  with figures of 4 2 4 2  He also became only the second bowler to bowl 20 dot balls in a T20 World Cup game  after Ajantha Mendis in 2012  Ugandan pace rocks PNG Alpesh Ramjani gave Uganda a wicket on the second ball when left hand batter Assad Vala played back to the left arm spinner  who angled the ball from around the wicket and on to the stumps  Miyagi and Cosmas Kyewuta then kept PNG on the back foot with their pace  Left hand batter Sese Bau couldn t clear Miyagi over mid off where Roger Mukasa took a tumbling catch going backwards  Kyewuta then got the big one when Tony Ura  PNG s highest run scorer in T20Is  also holed out to Mukasa  Lega Siaka was run out for 12 in the seventh over  trying to take a second run as he felt under pressure playing out dots against the two fast bowlers  Nsubuga on target When Nsubuga slid one through Charles Amini s leg stump in the 11th over  he became the second oldest bowler to take a wicket in the T20 World Cup  Nsubuga then had Hiri Hiri lbw although on first view it looked like the batter had come too far down the wicket  The review  though  went in Uganda s favour  Ramjani s second wicket came when he also trapped Kiplin Doriga lbw for 12  Captain Brian Masaba then got into the act with a topspinner that went through Chad Soper s defences  Miyagi and Kyewuta took the last two wickets  as PNG were bowled out with five balls to spare  Nao hits back Alei Nao gave PNG an identical start to PNG when he removed Mukasa in the first over for a second straight duck  Norman Vanua then removed Robinson Obuya who holed out to mid on where Vala didn t have to move to complete the catch  Nao then had Simon Ssesazi lbw in the third over as PNG slipped to a perilous 6 for 3  Ramjani then struck a nice boundary through the off side as he and Riazat tried to get Uganda out of trouble  Soper  though  got the seam up delivery to scissor through Ramjani in the sixth over  When PNG captain Vala had Dinesh Nakrani caught and bowled  PNG were on the ascendancy  Riazat s calmness prevails When Uganda were 35 for 5  Amini dropped Riazat when he was on 8  It was a simple chance at point after Riazat had played a false shot  but it turned out to be the turning point in Uganda s chase  Riazat registered his only boundary in the 11th over when he struck a nice cover drive against Vala  He added 35 runs for the sixth wicket with Miyagi  but the latter was run out after a mix up in the 14th over  Riazat kept calm despite the dismissal  though PNG also kept helping Uganda  Bau dropped Kenneth Waiswa on 4  although Riazat finally fell in the 18th over  John Kariko took a good catch at deep third  though it was a little too late for PNG ,Uganda s bowlers and Riazat seal their first win in T20 World Cup history  PNG s bowlers gave some hope after they folded for their lowest T20I score ever  but Uganda held their nerve in the end ,A hard fought three wicket win on a challenging pitch gave Uganda their maiden win at the T20 World Cup  They beat Papua New Guinea  PNG  in a low scoring game in Guyana where both teams vied for their first win in the competition  PNG s batting crumbled to 77 all out after being put to bat  before Uganda  themselves in trouble at 26 for 5  reached home in the 19th over  Riazat Ali Shah  one of Uganda s rising stars  used a low backlift in his careful 33 off 56 to shepherd them through the tricky chase  falling just three runs shy of Uganda s target  PNG were left to rue their poor batting  but they also conceded 15 wides  the second biggest contribution on the scorecard  But the story of the evening was Uganda s bowling in the first innings  set up by the pair of 43 year old Frank Nsubuga and 21 year old Juma Miyagi  Both vindicated their inclusion in this game with superb spells  Nsubuga bowled the most economical spell  minimum four overs  in T20 World Cup history  with figures of 4 2 4 2  He also became only the second bowler to bowl 20 dot balls in a T20 World Cup game  after Ajantha Mendis in 2012  Ugandan pace rocks PNG Alpesh Ramjani gave Uganda a wicket on the second ball when left hand batter Assad Vala played back to the left arm spinner  who angled the ball from around the wicket and on to the stumps  Miyagi and Cosmas Kyewuta then kept PNG on the back foot with their pace  Left hand batter Sese Bau couldn t clear Miyagi over mid off where Roger Mukasa took a tumbling catch going backwards  Kyewuta then got the big one when Tony Ura  PNG s highest run scorer in T20Is  also holed out to Mukasa  Lega Siaka was run out for 12 in the seventh over  trying to take a second run as he felt under pressure playing out dots against the two fast bowlers  Nsubuga on target When Nsubuga slid one through Charles Amini s leg stump in the 11th over  he became the second oldest bowler to take a wicket in the T20 World Cup  Nsubuga then had Hiri Hiri lbw although on first view it looked like the batter had come too far down the wicket  The review  though  went in Uganda s favour  Ramjani s second wicket came when he also trapped Kiplin Doriga lbw for 12  Captain Brian Masaba then got into the act with a topspinner that went through Chad Soper s defences  Miyagi and Kyewuta took the last two wickets  as PNG were bowled out with five balls to spare  Nao hits back Alei Nao gave PNG an identical start to PNG when he removed Mukasa in the first over for a second straight duck  Norman Vanua then removed Robinson Obuya who holed out to mid on where Vala didn t have to move to complete the catch  Nao then had Simon Ssesazi lbw in the third over as PNG slipped to a perilous 6 for 3  Ramjani then struck a nice boundary through the off side as he and Riazat tried to get Uganda out of trouble  Soper  though  got the seam up delivery to scissor through Ramjani in the sixth over  When PNG captain Vala had Dinesh Nakrani caught and bowled  PNG were on the ascendancy  Riazat s calmness prevails When Uganda were 35 for 5  Amini dropped Riazat when he was on 8  It was a simple chance at point after Riazat had played a false shot  but it turned out to be the turning point in Uganda s chase  Riazat registered his only boundary in the 11th

49.txt,Scotland showed that they mean business at this T20 World Cup with Michael Jones and George Munsey forging ahead to 90 without loss in an innings cut in half by heavy rain  But the weather eventually ruined their opening match against defending champions England  An untimely rain squall  followed by a damp spot on the pitch  delayed the start by 55 minutes after Scotland had won the toss and opted to bat  A much heavier storm arrived to halt proceedings again just two balls after the powerplay with Scotland reaching 51 for nought off the back of some assured hitting from Jones  who was unbeaten on 30 from 20 balls at the time  and Munsey  who had earlier been let off by a Mark Wood no ball  By the time the skies cleared and the ground was mopped up sufficiently  the match had been reduced to 10 overs per side  Jones and Munsey added 39 runs in the remaining 3 4 overs after the restart to push their score to 90 without loss and England were set an adjusted target of 109 to win  But as soon as they finished  the rain returned for good and condemned the contest to a wash out  Scotland start swiftly  Wood found some late inswing with the first ball of the match  which had Munsey on the hop immediately  But Munsey settled to pick up Wood s fourth ball from outside off stump and power it over mid on for four  Munsey had reached 16 when he skied a Wood delivery towards deep third with Jos Buttler running back from behind the stumps to take the catch  However  the sound of the no ball siren dampened England s celebrations as replays showed Wood had over stepped by a considerable margin  Scotland were 34 without loss after that fifth over  then Jones swung Chris Jordan for an 87 metre six which smashed a solar panel on the roof of the stand beyond deep midwicket  It was the first of three consecutive boundaries  the next a four punched through the covers and another scything through midwicket  as Jones took 15 runs off the over to power his side to the end of the powerplay on 49 for nought  He and Munsey added just two more runs  however  before more rain arrived and halted play for the best part of two hours    And finish strongly Play resumed with 3 4 overs remaining in Scotland s innings  With Jofra Archer and Wood unavailable with a new maximum of two overs per bowler  Adil Rashid was introduced to bowl the eighth over  Jones clubbed Rashid s first ball over long on for six and Munsey chimed in with a four and a six to push the scoring along  England kept the faith in Jordan s renowned death bowling despite his expensive first over and Munsey thrashed the second ball of his next over the fence at backward square for six  Rashid was more miserly in the final over  conceding just four runs off the first five balls before Jones pulled the last ball through midwicket for four to take his side to 90 without loss  It wasn t a chanceless innings after the restart with Munsey surviving an England review for caught behind off a googly in Rashid s first over and Jones making his ground despite his bat sticking in the pitch as he ran over the crease to beat a direct hit when the Scotland duo took a second run off Jordan s last ball  At that moment  the rain returned  but the 10 overs were completed  all to no avail as the showers set in  Archer s homecoming Having waited so long to play international cricket in his birthplace of Bridgetown  Archer s comeback continued with a two over spell  the first going for 10 runs  all to Jones who pounced on some extra width to dispatch his third ball through the covers for four  Archer s second over was much tighter as he deployed his leg cutter and only conceded two singles  closing with a short  fast delivery which brushed Jones  glove as he attempted to pull and  fortunately for the batter  didn t reach Buttler behind the stumps  Archer s appearance in the second T20I at home against Pakistan late last month was his first professional match in more than a year following a lengthy battle with injuries  There  he took 2 for 28 and hit speeds of 92mph 148kph which further soured this rain affected match  Amid the rain restrictions  England could

stepped by a considerable margin  Scotland were 34 without loss after that fifth over  then Jones swung Chris Jordan for an 87 metre six which smashed a solar panel on the roof of the stand beyond deep midwicket  It was the first of three consecutive boundaries  the next a four punched through the covers and another scything through midwicket  as Jones took 15 runs off the over to power his side to the end of the powerplay on 49 for nought  He and Munsey added just two more runs  however  before more rain arrived and halted play for the best part of two hours    And finish strongly Play resumed with 3 4 overs remaining in Scotland s innings  With Jofra Archer and Wood unavailable with a new maximum of two overs per bowler  Adil Rashid was introduced to bowl the eighth over  Jones clubbed Rashid s first ball over long on for six and Munsey chimed in with a four and a six to push the scoring along  England kept the faith in Jordan s renowned death bowling despite his expensive first over and Munsey thrashed the second ball of his next over the fence at backward square for six  Rashid was more miserly in the final over  conceding just four runs off the first five balls before Jones pulled the last ball through midwicket for four to take his side to 90 without loss  It wasn t a chanceless innings after the restart with Munsey surviving an England review for caught behind off a googly in Rashid s first over and Jones making his ground despite his bat sticking in the pitch as he ran over the crease to beat a direct hit when the Scotland duo took a second run off Jordan s last ball  At that moment  the rain returned  but the 10 overs were completed  all to no avail as the showers set in  Archer s homecoming Having waited so long to play international cricket in his birthplace of Bridgetown  Archer s comeback continued with a two over spell  the first going for 10 runs  all to Jones who pounced on some extra width to dispatch his third ball through the covers for four  Archer s second over was much tighter as he deployed his leg cutter and only conceded two singles  closing with a short  fast delivery which brushed Jones  glove as he attempted to pull and  fortunately for the batter  didn t reach Buttler behind the stumps  Archer s appearance in the second T20I at home against Pakistan late last month was his first professional match in more than a year following a lengthy battle with injuries  There  he took 2 for 28 and hit speeds of 92mph 148kph which further soured this rain affected match  Amid the rain restrictions  England could only wonder what more he might have done ,Scotland showed that they mean business at this T20 World Cup with Michael Jones and George Munsey forging ahead to 90 without loss in an innings cut in half by heavy rain. But the weather eventually ruined their opening match against defending champions England. An untimely rain squall  followed by a damp spot on the pitch delayed the start by 55 minutes after Scotland had won the toss and opted to bat.,0.04785894206549118,0.007575757575757575,0.032745591939546605,0.22222222222222227,0.02061855670103093,0.12121212121212122,0.2570857962469285,0.8332561906957716,0.9822,0.037,0.6226,0.036000000000000004

yielded just 24 runs  and they had their lowest ten over score  40 for 5  South Africa s four seam attack adapted to conditions quickly  went fuller upfront  varied pace well and were disciplined  Their headliner was Anrich Nortje  who put in his best performance since returning from a stress fracture that sidelined him from the international game for almost nine months  Nortje s 4 for 7  his career best figures  was embroidered with high class pace   he touched 150kph   and excellent use of the slower ball  He was complemented by World Cup debutant Ottneil Baartman  who bowled 20 dot balls in total  the joint most by a bowler in an innings at a T20 World Cup  equalling Ajantha Mendis against Zimbabwe in 2012  As a result of the South Africans combined efforts  only three Sri Lankan batters got into double figures  and only one partnership   their seventh wicket stand between Dasun Shanaka and Angelo Mathews   was worth more than 20  They ll rue not getting another 20 or

fifth ball as Kamindu Mendis tried to flick him over square leg but the shot lacked power and found Reeza Hendricks instead  Kusal Mendis tried to clear a 150kph ball over the big square boundary but

saw out the next two balls with the respect they deserved  He took a single off the last delivery to spoil what would have been a flawless over from Mathews  who was replaced by Dasun Shanaka for the next over  That brought the reward Sri Lanka wanted  when Shanaka squared Markram up with a delivery that seamed away  took the outside edge and was well caught low down by Kusal Mendis at wide first

boundaries but his counterattack came to an end when left arm spinner Bernard Scholtz trapped him lbw in the seventh over  Namibia dry out the boundaries With the spinners Scholtz and Erasmus bowling in tandem  Oman managed just five runs from the two overs after the powerplay  Ayaan Khan then attacked Scholtz for Oman s first six of the innings to reach 60 for 4 at the halfway mark  But Namibia bowled 44 deliveries without conceding a boundary  allowing Oman just 29 runs in this period  which resulted in two more wickets  Ayaan was caught at long off off Erasmus and the Namibia skipper trapped Mohammad Nadeem in front in his next over  Oman tried to attack late  but Wiese and Trumpelmann helped close the innings out  with the former bowling a two wicket over en route to a three for  Bilal Khan sets the tone  Ilyas applies the squeeze Bilal got early movement as well and was able to give his team a breakthrough when Michael van Lingen got an inside edge onto the stumps in the first over  Namibia went through the rest of the powerplay unscathed  but were scoring at under six an over  They struggled against spin  with Ilyas bowling a maiden over  The pressure led to Nikolaas Davin   dropped by Mehran off his own bowling in the eighth over   hitting Ilyas for a six over long on but then skying a catch to long off while trying to go for another big hit  The boundaries dried up again as Frylinck and Erasmus tried to steady Namibia  although Oman had multiple chances to break the partnership  only for another caught and bowled chance to go down when Ilyas gave Frylinck a life in the 11th over when he was on 21  Two overs later  Frylinck was given another reprieve  on 24  when he was dropped at deep midwicket  Having come so close  Oman will be left ruing the chances they put down  with Frylinck eventually anchoring Namibia to the last over ,Namibia beat Oman in a one over eliminator to start their T20 World Cup 2024 campaign with a win. Oman mounted a dramatic comeback with the ball after being bundled out for 109 to take the match to a Super Over. Namibia bowled 44 deliveries without conceding a boundary allowing Oman just 29 runs in this period  which resulted in two more wickets. David Wiese and Gerhard Erasmus racked up 21 runs against the seasoned Bilal Khan.,0.04343105320304017,0.015233949945593035,0.034744842562432134,0.2718446601941748,0.019801980198019802,0.15533980582524273,0.3849796666112547,1.362233322294556,0.9877,0.033,0.8271,0.093
