A devastating 87 not out from Phil Salt  supplemented by an unbeaten 48 from Jonny Bairstow  saw England thrash West Indies by eight wickets in St Lucia  It was the kind of performance that set down a marker for the rest of the teams in the Super Eight of the T20 World Cup 2024  The defending champions made light work of their target of 181  with a clinical 97 run stand between Salt and Bairstow earning victory with 15 deliveries to spare  Played out on a fine batting deck at the Daren Sammy National Stadium  Jos Buttler opted to chase at the toss  Things looked precarious after eight overs  with West Indies getting 72 on the board for the loss of just Brandon King  who collapsed with a side strain early in the fifth over  having scored 23 off his previous 12 deliveries  A diet of spin restricted West Indies  batters thanks to Adil Rashid   the pick of the bowlers with 1 for 21 from his four overs   and Moeen Ali  who would go on to remove Johnson Charles  Rovman Powell  promoting himself to No  4  took 20 from the 15th over  striking Liam Livingstone for three sixes down the ground in four deliveries  But an attempt at a fourth off Livingstone s final ball brought his downfall  caught low at short third by Mark Wood  returning to the XI in place of Chris Jordan  It was the first of three wickets to fall in the space of 12 deliveries for just six runs  Jofra Archer removed Nicholas Pooran caught behind in the next over  before Andre Russell nailed a Rashid googly straight to wide long on  That West Indies were able to reach 180 without any further loss from a position of 143 for 4 with three overs to go owes as much to Sherfane Rutherford as it does to Wood  The former was able to find 28 from 15 deliveries  13 of them off the latter as the 18th over was taken for 19  England s pursuit began steadily enough  reaching 58 for no loss after six overs  Roston Chase s flat delivery eventually ended the opening stand on 67  trapping Buttler in front  before Moeen came and went  batting at No  3 for the first time since March 2023  Salt remained  and though he did end up slowing down  Bairstow was on hand to pick up the slack  striking 46 off 21 up to the 16th over  It was then that Salt tagged back in  and unfurled a brutal attack on Romario Shepherd  striking the seamer for 30 with three fours and three sixes   the joint most expensive over by a West Indian in a T20 World Cup  The first of those boundaries brought up Salt s half century from 38 deliveries  before he skewered any remaining jeopardy  It left West Indies to rue a half chance to remove Salt on seven in the third over  when he toed a hack across the line through to Pooran  who could not hold on  Bairstow clicks himself  and Salt  into gear Salt deserved the Player of the Match award  But without Bairstow s help  he   and maybe even England   might not have had something to celebrate  Salt had emerged from the powerplay with a respectable 35 off 20  But with the field spread  twirlers working in tandem and less of the strike  he had stalled  Going into the 14th over  he had scored just 12 more from 15 deliveries  That was when Bairstow set about a jump start  For some reason  Powell returned to Alzarri Joseph instead of persisting with the frugal Chase  Bairstow used the pace on the ball to send the first delivery over the deep midwicket fence   the longer side  no less   before ramping the next delivery for four  Powell attempted to correct his error by bringing Akeal Hosein back on for his final over  Bairstow  though  was in an unforgiving mood  An attempted reverse sweep brought a subdued lbw appeal before a conventional sweep  a 76 metre six heaved into the stands at midwicket  and a fortuitous inside edge brought 14 from three deliveries  The 16 from the over outright made it Hosein s most expensive of this World Cup  It was at that point  with 40 needed from 30  that Salt set about his assault on Shepherd  Bairstow watched on from the other end  settling into the role of cheerleader as his partner went ballistic  He eventually had the honour of striking the winning run  raising his personal best at T20 World Cups to 48 not out   Once Jos got out  I had to be the better to bat through   explained Salt   For Jonny to come out and take the pressure off me by taking calculated risks  I couldn t be happier about that as a teammate   Windies given the run around Intent comes in many different forms  England blitzed the six count on the tournament s truest batting pitch  but the difference between the running out in the middle told as true a story  West Indies  for all their might  set a new unwanted record of 51 dot balls   the most any team has registered in a T20 World Cup when posting a score of at least 180  They were also responsible for the previous highest   50   in the 2016 edition  albeit when they chased down 193 to take down India in the semi final on their way to their second title  Moreover  they were second best when making use of this ground s lop sided dimensions  failing to rotate the strike as much as they could  and running just nine twos across their 120 deliveries  Not only did England run three more in 15 fewer deliveries  but they even managed a three in the fourth over when Buttler could not quite time a cut to the cover point sponge  It brought Salt on strike for the final ball of the over  which he used to get going by charging at Russell and launching him back over his head and onto the roof for the first of five sixes  Archer glee At the time  the purchasing of Powell s wicket for 20 runs from Livingstone s only over did not seem a smart deal  Powell was only averaging 16 25 coming into this match  Having cooled a partisan St Lucian crowd  watching their captain hoist three quick sixes was a surefire way to get them warmed up for the arrival of Russell to assist Pooran  who was set on 32  Both were back in the hut 11 deliveries later  And while Rashid s snaring of Russell was the icing on the cake in this little stanza that shifted the match England s way  it was Archer s in the 17th over that vindicated Buttler s investment  Over the wicket to Pooran  Archer hammered a tight line across the left hander  Ranging from full and yorker length  barring one misstep   a full toss third ball which Pooran guided through point for four   Archer had it all his own way  He was too sharp   consistently around the 90mph mark   and too unwavering for a batter slowly falling into a funk  desperate for room to access his favoured hitting zones down the ground  The least full of all the deliveries was the one that took the edge through to Buttler  Pooran presenting the face of the bat in defeat rather than defiance  With six wickets  Archer is now England s joint top wicket taker alongside Rashid  boasting an economy rate of 6 58  which is lower than any of his teammates barring Reece Topley  5 50   who has played two fewer games and is still yet to register a dismissal  But the best stat of all is that Archer has now turned out five times for England in the last 15 days  The previous five caps came in the space of 448 days  After the nightmare run of elbow and back injuries over the last two years  the 29 year old may finally be out the other end
