There were geniuses at play in Bridgetown  wearing the India blue as they cruised to victory in their first Super Eight game against Afghanistan in the T20 World Cup 2024  The pitch  once again  was tough to bat on  slow and offering purchase to everyone willing to roll their fingers across the ball  Suryakumar Yadav  though  found a way to prosper as he often does in T20 cricket  helping his team post an above par total of 181 for 7  That brought Jasprit Bumrah into the fray and he immediately set about dismantling Afghanistan  his two early strikes leaving them indisposed for the rest of the chase  The old guard Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma did not play a single T20I between the end of the previous World Cup in 2022 and January this year  But they re here now because they want that medal around their neck  They want to be world champions  And to that end  they ve been open to batting in a different way  Rohit made only 8 off 13 but he looked to hit a boundary off six of those balls  Kohli was going smoothly but he wasn t willing to settle for that  He looked to hit Rashid Khan for six and got caught  After being burned in big matches for being too conservative  India have ditched the safety first approach  And the reason for that played out in the middle overs of this game  When Kohli fell  ESPNcricinfo s Forecaster had their total tracking down by 18 runs to 171  In the space of a mere six balls  the other batters had it tracking back up by the same number of runs  India were set to reach 189 now  That s how quickly a game can change in this format  That s why it s better to have tried and failed than not try and all  Surya on song It s possible India knew this all along but were holding back because they weren t comfortable with the options they had down the order  That s changed now because their best T20 batter mans the No  4 position  Suryakumar played some special shots   not in the way you usually associate with  where he finds a soft spot in the laws of physics and mercilessly pokes holes in them  But more in terms of just knowing his areas and trusting his skill  Even the one time when he made jaws drop to the floor   dragging Azmatullah Omarzai from somewhere off the wide line to the square leg boundary   he was just trying to put away a full toss  The legside was the shorter boundary  It just made sense  Suryakumar focused on three things while he was out there  Sweep to mess with the wristspinners  He played four and each of them resulted in a boundary  Smash whenever the quicks went too full  He struck a six that sailed into the three Ws stand and held his pose  Worrell  Weeks and Walcott would ve loved that  Finally swipe   after making sure to hold his shape   when they went slower ball  First time he tried it  he got beaten  Second time  he nearly hit the ball out of the ground  This was a classic case of an attacking batter paring down his options to just those he knew would succeed in the conditions  Suryakumar was box office  even without bat in hand  In between the innings  he admitted that he was nervous   I began chewing my gum harder when Kohli got out   But he knew he couldn t let himself be bogged down   It was important to keep the intent up   India do not want to fall into the same traps as before  This World Cup  they re going to bat like they have a full ten wickets to spare  Bumrah on fire He has twice as many wickets as he s conceded boundaries  8 vs 4  in this T20 World Cup  Bumrah is undeniably India s most important player  He came on to bowl after Rahmanullah Gurbaz had struck a lion s share of the 13 runs in the first over of the chase  He had seen  in the first innings  that slower balls had been mighty effective  five wickets for 30 runs at an economy rate of 7 2   Immediately  he dialled one up and also shifted his line real wide to deny Gurbaz the straight hit that he likes so much  Assessing the conditions and the opposition to that degree that quickly is the reason why he is an all format great  He gave away only seven runs  the second fewest by an Indian bowling four overs in a T20I  There were further positives as well  Kuldeep Yadav  back in the XI to exploit favourable conditions  picked up 2 for 32  Axar Patel began with a wicket maiden in the powerplay  Ravindra Jadeja had a good run out as well  And Arshdeep recovered from a two over spell for 22 runs to almost pick up a hat trick in the dying moments
