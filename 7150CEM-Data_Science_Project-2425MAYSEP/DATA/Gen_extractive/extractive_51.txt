South Africa opened their T20 World Cup campaign in authoritative fashion by bowling Sri Lanka out for their lowest total in the format and chasing 78 runs inside 17 overs to secure two points  At the first official T20I match to be played at the newly created stadium at Eisenhower Park  we learnt more about the conditions than either of the two sides  The surface is tricky to bat on  there s inconsistent bounce  not much turn and the venue has big square boundaries  which are difficult to breach  Sri Lanka chose to bat first and were on the back foot almost immediately  Their powerplay yielded just 24 runs  and they had their lowest ten over score  40 for 5  South Africa s four seam attack adapted to conditions quickly  went fuller upfront  varied pace well and were disciplined  Their headliner was Anrich Nortje  who put in his best performance since returning from a stress fracture that sidelined him from the international game for almost nine months  Nortje s 4 for 7  his career best figures  was embroidered with high class pace   he touched 150kph   and excellent use of the slower ball  He was complemented by World Cup debutant Ottneil Baartman  who bowled 20 dot balls in total  the joint most by a bowler in an innings at a T20 World Cup  equalling Ajantha Mendis against Zimbabwe in 2012  As a result of the South Africans combined efforts  only three Sri Lankan batters got into double figures  and only one partnership   their seventh wicket stand between Dasun Shanaka and Angelo Mathews   was worth more than 20  They ll rue not getting another 20 or 30 runs because that could have made things really tricky for South Africa  At 58 for 4 in the 13th over  100 would have been a tough ask but 78 was within reach  Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller took them home with 22 balls to spare  In all  127 out of the 214 balls faced by the batters in this game were dots  the most dots in a Men s T20 World Cup game  Baartman strikes with his first ball Dreams do come true and Baartman is living proof of that  After a decade in the domestic system with little recognition and a dalliance with giving up cricket for a career in the South African National Defence Force  he was the SA20 s leading wicket taker this season until the final  when Marco Jansen leapfrogged him  and earned a call up to the T20 World Cup squad  Before last month  he had never even been out of South Africa but if the magnitude of the occasion overwhelmed him you d never have known  Given the ball in the fourth over  Baartman saw the lengths Jansen employed and delivered his first one full and wide  Pathum Nissanka sensed an opportunity to clear deep third but got a thick edge to Heinrich Klaasen and made Baartman the first South African bowler  and 18th overall  to take a wicket with his opening delivery at a World Cup  Nortje s storms back The numbers   11 T20 matches since comeback from a stress fracture in March  40 overs  449 runs  nine wickets   suggested picking Nortje was a risk but the coach  Rob Walter  believed otherwise  He backed Nortje s selection based on his raw pace and the ability to vary it  and Nortje justified his backing in spectacular fashion  Brought on as the fifth bowler  after the powerplay  Nortje followed what he saw his fellow quicks doing and resisted the short ball for fuller lengths  He was rewarded with his fifth ball as Kamindu Mendis tried to flick him over square leg but the shot lacked power and found Reeza Hendricks instead  Kusal Mendis tried to clear a 150kph ball over the big square boundary but was well caught by Tristan Stubbs  looking into the sun  Charith Asalanka went the same way as Kamindu  and Angelo Mathews was rushed into the hook shot and top edged  Nortje finished with impeccable figures of 4 for 7  Mathews vs Markram Aiden Markram captained South Africa to the Under 19 World Cup title in 2014  Mathews was part of the Sri Lankan side that won the 2014 T20 World Cup  And neither of them  nor their countries  have enjoyed international triumph since so there was something special about them facing off in the third over of South Africa s innings  Mathews controlled the exchange  with length balls on off stump  and then issued a warning  He found seam movement that jagged into Markram at around 120kph and hit him on the box  Markram needed some medical attention and saw out the next two balls with the respect they deserved  He took a single off the last delivery to spoil what would have been a flawless over from Mathews  who was replaced by Dasun Shanaka for the next over  That brought the reward Sri Lanka wanted  when Shanaka squared Markram up with a delivery that seamed away  took the outside edge and was well caught low down by Kusal Mendis at wide first slip  The boundaries  finally There weren t very many to choose from  with only three fours and three sixes in Sri Lanka s innings and the same number from South Africa to create a  an antidote to the IPL and b  a match of old fashioned grind and some tension  What there was dissipated when Heinrich Klaasen  arguably the best boundary hitter at the event  hit Wanindu Hasaranga over long on and then straight down the ground for six and then four to all but end the match  With those two shots  Klaasen showed off the quality of the base from which he hits the ball and the power with which he hits it  and South Africa will hope to see a lot more of that as the tournament goes on  For today  it was enough to secure victory
