Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek s three wicket hauls backed up by Max O Dowd s patient half century got Netherlands over the line in a nervy chase in their opening game of the T20 World Cup 2024  against a spirited Nepal in Dallas  It was a rude welcome for Nepal in their first T20 World Cup in a decade  with the Netherlands bowlers putting up a fine show and bowling them out for a mere 106 in 19 2 overs  But Nepal weren t done yet  They squeezed the Netherlands batters in the middle overs and took the chase into the 19th over  O Dowd  however  held his own with an unbeaten 54  He rode his luck and made sure to take his side over the line by six wickets and eight balls to spare  Early morning rain and overcast conditions delayed the toss by 30 minutes and Netherlands captain Scott Edwards had no hesitations in bowling after winning the toss  The bowlers backed up their captain s decision with Pringle  van Beek  Paul van Meekeren and Bas de Leede all getting among the wickets  In reply  Nepal put up a fight but dropped a couple of crucial chances at key intervals  Dallas turns blue and red  but Orange holds sway The Grand Prairie Stadium can seat 7000 but the vocal Nepal fans made it feel a lot bigger  flocking in nice and early getting behind their team  But the overcast conditions assisted the Netherlands seamers and they got their first wicket through left arm spinner Pringle  whose decision to keep giving the ball flight paid off as Aasif Sheikh s thick outside edge found short third in the second over  Pacer van Beek then struck with his first ball  angling a length ball sharply back into Kushal Bhurtel and catching him plumb in front  Fast bowler Vivian Kingma also found big movement as the Nepal batters found putting bat to ball an arduous task  In the first six overs  Nepal played and missed 17 of the 36 balls  47 22    which is the highest for any team in a men s T20I  for which ESPNcricinfo has ball by ball data available   They hit five fours but could only manage three singles and a two in the first six overs  as Nepal managed only 29 runs in the powerplay for the loss of two wickets  A stranglehold in the middle and at the death Rohit Paudel  the youngest captain at a T20 World Cup at 21  kept his composure but lost partners at a steady rate  He pumped Kingma for a four over covers in the seventh over  but Pringle came back in his second over to remove Anil Sah  his attempted sweep only going as far as deep backward square leg  Kushal Malla hammered van Meekeren for a four over mid off but fell three balls later trying a repeat of that shot  deceived by the slower offcutter and spooning the ball straight up  Bas de Leede then got rid of Dipendra Singh Airee caught at slip as Nepal slipped to 53 for 5 after 11 overs  Paudel was busy during his 35 off 37 but ultimately perished giving Pringle his third wicket  Karan KC and Gulsan Jha added 22 off 17 balls for the eighth wicket   the second highest stand of the innings   to push the score past 100  Van Beek ended the innings with a two in two  Nepal apply the choke Early wickets was the need of the hour  and Nepal managed that with Sompal Kami getting rid of Michael Levitt with his second ball  caught by the cover fielder  Both Kami and Karan kept the bowling tight conceding only four runs in the first 15 balls  Vikramjit Singh broke the shackles with two back to back fours but run scoring remained slow  Nepal bowled 19 dot balls in the powerplay as Netherlands reached 36 for 1 after the first six  It was going to get tougher for Netherlands in the middle overs  with the spinners coming into the equation  Airee conceded just a single in his first over after the powerplay  before taking out Vikramjit with a length ball that beat the batter s attempted slog sweep and caught him in front  An over earlier Vikramjit was dropped at deep backward square leg by Kami  but he couldn t cash in  O Dowd and Sybrand Engelbrecht tried to steady to ship in a 28 run stand before a run out brought about the latter s end  O Dowd struck a straight drive back at Kami  who expertly deflected the ball back onto the non striker s stumps and caught Engelbrecht short  Nepal conceded just 48 runs in the middle overs  6 to 15  making Netherlands fight for every run  Composed O Dowd steers Netherlands home When Edwards fell cheaply  it felt Netherlands  chase could go astray  but O Dowd brought all his experience into play  He curbed his natural aggressive instincts and made sure he kept his end secure even when Netherlands went 40 balls without a boundary between the 12th and 18th overs  O Dowd had a huge slice of luck when Paudel spilled a straightforward chance in the 18th over at long off  He was on 40 at the time and Netherlands still needed 18 off 17  but the dropped chance seemed to ease his nerves  In the penultimate over  with Netherlands requiring 13 off 12  he smashed Abinash Bohara for a four and six to reach his 13th T20I fifty  De Leede then finished the chase with a four through covers  triggering a sigh of relief in the Netherlands camp and securing two crucial points
