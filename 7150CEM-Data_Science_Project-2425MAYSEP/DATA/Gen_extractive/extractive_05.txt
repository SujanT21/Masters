Rohit Sharma is the reason India are in the T20 World Cup 2024 semi finals  He was sublime  But then again he has been for a long time  simply with his commitment to an attacking game at personal cost  It deserves credit but until now it s come in intangible form  Perhaps in five days  time  it will take the shape of an ICC trophy  On a sunny morning in St Lucia  India s captain scored 76 of his 92 runs in boundaries and left Australia with nowhere to hide  He even prompted them into mistakes  A total of 205 built on a series of broken records proved too much  It even offered insulation against Travis Head and that  in recent times  has been so rare it s almost unheard of  Australia may yet make the final four  but they need Bangladesh to do them a favour and beat Afghanistan  by non colossal margins  in St Vincent later on Monday  Rohit s rampage On November 19  he was supposed to lead his team to glory but instead walked away with tears in his eyes  On June 24  he had reason to believe all that hurt might rise up again when his opening partner and world beating bestie Virat Kohli fell for a duck  Some might have taken a backward step  Rohit took Mitchell Starc for 29 runs in an over instead  He was 50 off 19 in the fifth over  The other end had contributed 2 off 13  India s 52 was the lowest score at which an individual player had brought up a half century in T20Is where ball by ball data is available  Rohit was not playing  Pitch it up and get punished Australia  though  played right into Rohit s hands  Starc  for example  kept going full  It s his one job  Try to find swing  Try to break stumps  But at the Daren Sammy Stadium  that was the wrong length  Josh Hazlewood showed the way there  He pitched up only two times in his entire spell and those were yorkers  Every other ball was on a length or just short of it and he came away with figures of 1 for 14  Rohit was invited to play his front foot shots 24 times and he scored 71 runs  including seven of his eight sixes and five of his seven fours  Rohit s shots Six of the 11 overs that Rohit was out there for went for double digits  He was batting like he does in ODI cricket  when he s 200 not out  Going down on one knee and slog sweeping Pat Cummins  who came into this game with back to back hat tricks  for a six that thudded onto the roof of the stadium  Coming down the track like water flowing down a cliff   so devastatingly smooth   to smack Marcus Stoinis on the up over extra cover  Trying a version of the scoop but ending up with a version of the pull   new addition to the playlist  Bottom line was everything he was doing was working for him  Even a defensive push to cover had such an aura behind it that Australia ended up misfielding and giving up a second run  Starc s recovery India scored 10 fours and 10 sixes while Rohit was at the crease  After he fell  they could manage only nine combined  Starc deserves credit for that  He came back in the 12th over  shifted his angle around the wicket to deny Rohit the freedom of his arms  and although he still went full  this time he took pace off and that made enough of a difference  The bat couldn t touch ball and the stumps lay broken  Starc s slower delivery took out Suryakumar Yadav too  right in the middle of a masterclass of his own  scoring his runs in a way that don t always make sense  Cummins  once again  was the unlucky recipient as a ball that was close to the wide line ended up with a home on the square leg boundary  India went 21 deliveries without a boundary between the 15th and 18th overs but they still managed a finishing kick as Hardik Pandya nailed three sixes in the final two overs to push the total past 200  Head start David Warner fell in the first over of the chase and now there is risk that his 6 off 6 might be his last international outing  Australia still had batters capable of dictating terms out there though  Mitchell Marsh took the wicket taker Arshdeep Singh for two fours and a six in an over and Head did even better by hitting Jasprit Bumrah off the length he likes to bowl with the new ball  That made the India quick turn to plan B   yorkers   and under pressure even he missed one and bowled a full toss  Australia finished the powerplay at 65 for 1  five runs better than India  Marsh s power game and Head s incredible skill at clearing his front leg and somehow opening vast swathes of the outfield on both sides had flipped the script  Axar s sensational catch India needed something special and it arrived in the form of Axar Patel  He was a few yards off the fence at deep square leg  which seemed like an error considering it was Marsh on strike  The slog sweep flew off his bat  Flat  Hard  Destined to go for six  A support staff member was even ducking for cover fearing it would beat the fielder  But Axar didn t let it  He leapt up  went for it with both hands  and got it with just his right  It was one of those that had to stick and it did  Every last one of his team mates ran up to him to celebrate that wicket  Against the run of play  a partnership of 81 off 48 was broken  Kuldeep s intervention Glenn Maxwell was busy negating the advantage India had thanks to the quality of their spinners  He saw that Ravindra Jadeja had no one on the boundary at third man and for that reason alone he went reverse sweep  which meant he was hitting with the turn  but against the wind  which when it was strong enough to basically carry Hardik away as he was running in to bowl  posed a significant problem  Maxwell s wrists somehow overcame that  He was looking dangerous  Maybe enough to take on Kuldeep Yadav  So he charged at India s wristspinner  and got bowled  That googly should be framed up on a wall somewhere  It messed with Maxwell on so many levels  It was slower than he wanted it to be  It was shorter than he needed it to be  It turned the exact opposite way  And it left his stumps a mess  The dip on that ball was everything  India struck twice in the three overs that followed  one of which was Bumrah foxing Head with his offcutter  Needing 53 from the last 18  the best Australia could do was reduce the margin of defeat
