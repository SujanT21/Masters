Scotland produced a stunning run chase to beat Namibia by five wickets in the T20 World Cup 2024  Returning to the Kensington Oval after their washout against England  they achieved a target of 156 with nine balls to spare  securing their first T20I victory over Namibia at the fourth attempt  A 74 run partnership between Richie Berrington and Michael Leask  ultimately  saw Scotland home  Berrington finished 47 not out after Leask injected impetus into the chase with a 17 ball 35  Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus had earlier turned matters in his side s favour with the ball  taking 2 for 29 after his 52 underpinned their 155 for 9 in the first innings  Erasmus  decision to win the toss and bat first on what has been an unpredictable Kensington Oval pitch was not immediately vindicated as Namibia found themselves 55 for 4  thanks largely to the excellence of the new ball pair of Brad Wheal and Brad Currie  But Erasmus put the Namibia innings on his back with his 11th fifty plus T20I score  37 of which came in a rebuilding stand of 51 with Zane Green for the fifth wicket  Despite losing George Munsey earlier in their chase  Scotland had chipped off 49 midway through the eighth over for the loss of just one  Michael Jones stepped up the gears  scoring 15 of the 18 runs in the final over of the powerplay  but Erasmus returned to the fray with to instigate a collapse  With his wily offspinners at one end  and Bernard Scholtz s slow left arm at the other  the pair pocketed three wickets between them as Scotland fell from 49 for 1 to 73 for 4 after 11 overs  It was at that point Leask joined forces with Berrington to take Scotland to the brink with a 42 ball partnership that included seven boundaries  including four sixes from Leask  Though he would fall  Berrington finished the match off in style  carting David Wiese into the pavilion at long on as Scotland triumphed to put them top of the group  Leask the beast How about that for a cameo  In just 17 balls  Leask turned this chase upside down and inside out  He arrived at a time when the boundaries had dried up  with Scotland requiring 80 from 50 deliveries  By the time he was done  that equation was 9 from 13  After playing out a dot ball first  he was never below a run a ball  and would score off all but one of his next 16  He was the ideal foil for Berrington  who  having been out there from the 10th over  was finally getting to grips with the pitch  Once Berrington had blown the horn on the boundary pursuit with a six and four off consecutive deliveries from Tangeni Lungameni  Leask took the lead  Erasmus was the first to get it  heaved to midwicket for the first of Leask s four sixes  Then came the killer  a 17th over that went for 19  David Wiese  the hero of Namibia s Super Over victory over Oman  was treated with disdain  sent over the sponge at cow corner twice by Leask   strikes which sandwiched a Berrington four in the same region  Leask s final six was his biggest of the lot   reading a slower ball from Ruben Trumpelmann and sending it back with interest over to the leg side for all of 101 meters  The scale of the strike was more than its distance as it took Scotland s ask to under a run a ball for the first time in the innings  Spin shocks Jocks After Michael Jones had blitzed the sixth over  Erasmus decided to take pace off  Together with Scholtz  they set about pinning Scotland s middle order down  Erasmus operated exclusively around the wicket  darting his off breaks across the right handers  limiting their scoring by restricting their ability to swing straight  Jones  half hearted attempt to do so resulted in a caught behind  An absent minded Brandon McMullen was then stumped at the second attempt after dancing down the pitch and failing to reclaim his ground with his back foot  Scholtz was subsisting on a wicket to wicket line at the other end  a frugal tactic that saw him go for just one boundary  In a bid to break the shackles  Matthew Cross fell lbw attempting to sweep a ball that was a touch too short to sweep  It spoke of the panic Namibia had concocted at the time  After a Powerplay of 43 for 1  the next six overs had produced 35 for 3  Erasmus all round display in vain  It would be better if had come in a win   bristled Erasmus at the end of the match  He s right  of course  For the longest time  it looked like it would  Before his two wickets had tilted the chase Namibia s way  his 52 from 31 had made the game competitive  The knock was an anomaly in a stodgy batting effort where opener Nikolaas Davin was the only other Namibian top order batter to strike in excess of 120  Erasmus struck his second ball for six  and his third for four   both coming at the start of the sixth over  as Scotland tried to sneak six balls from Mark Watt in at the end of the powerplay  The point region was peppered throughout  likewise midwicket  for all of his seven boundaries  Who knows how long he could have gone on had he controlled his aggression instead of trying to blast Leask over his head after slog sweeping him for six the ball before  The strike saw him pass JJ Smit s record of 51 T20I sixes for Namibia  Had others stood up  he would have been a worthy Player of the Match  Currie does it for the medium pacers In a tournament where the out and out quicks are already dominating the column inches  Currie put in a display that showed there is glory to be had with mediums  The 25 year old has been doing that for a while  both domestically for Sussex and with Scotland  coming into this match with a T20I record of 19 dismissals and an economy rate of 4 94  Those numbers have now moved in different directions after 2 for 16 from his four overs  Currie had the ball on a string throughout  mixing up cutters and the odd cross seam delivery amongst his stock deliveries  The left armer s first two overs utilised the swing on offer with the new ball  assisted by Cross standing up to the stumps to keep Davin and Jan Frylinck honest  While Davin was able to impart his own pace on the ball to strike a four through backward point in the fourth over   the only boundary against Currie   Frylinck played on when attempting to do the same two balls earlier  He returned for the 11th over  before conceding just three runs off the 19th  in which he varied his lengths to prevent the lower order from hitting down the ground  Trumpelmann s attempt at a six into the wind gave Currie a well deserved second wicket
