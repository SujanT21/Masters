Pakistan made it more complicated than it needed to be  but Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi led them to a nervy three wicket win to sign off their T20 World Cup campaign  Shaheen led the way with the ball with three early wickets and finished the contest off with two sixes  while Babar shepherded a chase that he watched fall apart with an unbeaten 32  Mohammad Amir and Haris Rauf joined Shaheen among the wickets as Ireland were reduced to 32 for 6  At that stage  an early afternoon finish appeared likely  but Gareth Delany and Mark Adair gritted their way through a 44 run partnership off 30 balls  Imad Wasim took care of the lower order with figures of 3 for 8 in four overs  in what is likely his last game for Pakistan  but a cameo of 22 from Josh Little took Ireland to 106  Pakistan were cruising through the chase after eight overs with Saim Ayub  Mohammad Rizwan and Babar doing their bit to take any sting out of Ireland s bowling attack  But a frenetic phase in the middle overs  when Curtis Campher and Barry McCarthy took four wickets for 10 runs  left Babar alone with a relatively long tail  But Abbas Afridi swung his way through a happy go lucky 17 to bring the target down to 12  while a calf injury for Little meant Ireland had to bowl spin at Shaheen  He finished with two heaved sixes to seal a win that gave Pakistan relief rather than satisfaction  Shaheen back in love with first overs After going eight successive T20Is without a first over wicket   his longest dry spell in his T20I career   Shaheen finally snapped the streak today  his third ball a perfect illustration of why he has historically been so effective up front  The new ball swung and seamed back in to pierce Andrew Balbirnie s defences and crash into the stumps  Two balls later  Shaheen got one to shape the other way  kissing Lorcan Tucker s outside edge on the way to Rizwan  There was nearly a third when Pakistan reviewed one that clipped Harry Tector s pad  and though that wasn t given  Shaheen trapped Tector in front in his next over  Ireland s recovery When Pakistan had Ireland at 32 for 6  any prospect of recovery was distant  But Ireland understood that continuing to attack was the most direct route to runs  In the tenth over  Gareth Delany hit Shadab s first ball for six and Mark Adair pulled the last one for four  They attacked Abbas Afridi  who had not played a competitive game since his inclusion in Pakistan s World Cup squad  for 16 runs in the 11th  It kept Ireland on track three figures  and when another slump came   from 76 for 6 to 80 for 9   Little and Ben White batted the remaining six overs  adding an unbeaten 26 for the last wicket  An hour later  they were almost rewarded for it  Pakistan s jitters Pakistan securing a straightforward win would have been an inauthentic end to the campaign they have had  and duly  the collapse came  If Pakistan felt they were sitting pretty halfway through the chase against India  it was nothing compared to the impregnability of their position against Ireland  Pakistan needed 55 in 12 overs with eight wickets in hand  with Babar and Fakhar Zaman batting  when Zaman drilled one to mid off  It was the catalyst for flutters through the whole of the Pakistan camp as Usman Khan was deceived by McCarthy s extra bounce in the tenth over  The memories of the chase that fell apart last Sunday were fresh as Shadab  to whom cricket is offering no hiding place at the moment  flicked his second ball to the wicketkeeper  Imad finally connected with the cut shot he s been trying since Ravindra Jadeja bowled against him  but straight to the man at point  An unassertive top order and a non existent middle order won t get you out of the first round at many World Cups  and this game was the perfect illustration of the point
