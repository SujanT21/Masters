Nuwan Thushara s last over brought Sri Lanka screaming back into the match late in the contest  He first bowled Rishad Hossain  and then nailed Taskin Ahmed in front of the stumps with a pinpoint swinging yorker  This left Bangladesh eight wickets down  with 12 runs still to get  and the game looked set to turn on its head  However  the experienced Mahmudullah was at the crease for Bangladesh  and despite some further nervy moments  pushed his side across the line off the last ball of the 19th over to give his side victory in their opening encounter of T20 World Cup 2024  The late Sri Lanka surge aside  this was a match chiefly decided by Bangladesh s own outstanding bowling in the first innings  Mustafizur Rahman was the best among them  using shorter lengths and his cutters efficiently  to claim figures of 3 for 17  Rishad s three for through the middle overs also pegged Sri Lanka back  Mustafizur was especially instrumental in Sri Lanka s downward spiral through the middle overs  which culminated in a crash and burn end  Ultimately  Sri Lanka s inability to find boundaries  or even rotate strike against good Bangladesh bowling resulted in their downfall  A score of 125 for 9 always seemed poor on a decent pitch  even if their bowlers made a match of it in the end  The tight finish It should never have got so close  With five overs to go  Bangladesh had only 25 runs left to get  five wickets in hand  and their two most experienced batters   Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah   were at the crease  But then Shakib uppercut a Matheesha Pathirana short ball  and Maheesh Theekshana took an outstanding diving catch at deep third  surging in from the rope to intercept the ball inches from the ground  And then Sri Lanka s other slinger  Thushara  took two wickets in two balls in the next over   the 18th of the innings  first bowling Rishad who had tried to hit him inside out over cover  and then nailing Taskin with a toe crusher that would have hit leg stump  Thushara had three more balls left in the over  with Bangladesh still needing 12  Sri Lanka s best chance of stealing victory was for him to get another wicket before his spell ended  But Tanzim Hasan Sakib survived  and Mahmudullah was on strike next over  Next over  bowled by Dasun Shanaka  Sri Lanka had used up all their frontliners hunting for wickets   Mahmudullah bludgeoned a thigh high full toss into the deep square leg stands to ease Bangladesh s nerves  But there was more drama to come  With two runs needed   but desperate to keep strike off the last ball of the 19th over   Mahmudullah ventured a risky single to mid off  and would have been out had Wanindu Hasaranga connected with his shy at the stumps  But the Sri Lanka captain didn t  and the overthrows helped Bangladesh limp over the line  Bangladesh boss bowling death overs The definitive period of play  though  were the last seven overs of Sri Lanka s innings  They had arrived at the start of the 14th over in okay shape   100 runs on the board and seven wickets in hand  But then they nosedived  Rishad first dismissed Charith Asalanka  having him caught slog sweeping at deep square leg  after his teammates had kept Asalanka quiet through much of the middle overs  Next ball  he had Hasaranga caught at slip with a ball that dipped and gripped  This double strike pushed Sri Lanka into a tailspin  losing their next six wickets for 25 runs  Only one boundary would be hit in the last six overs  as batters repeatedly tried cross batted shots against bowlers varying their pace and got themselves out  almost in frustration  Rishad got his three wickets in this period  and Taskin  Mustafizur  and Tanzim Hasan got one each  Nissanka s bright start That Sri Lanka even got to 125  rather than crashing out in double figures as they did against South Africa  was down to their best batter   opener Pathum Nissanka  He struck seven fours and a six  favouring the leg side  and maintained a strike rate of 168 across his 28 ball innings  The turning point for Sri Lanka s innings  after which they struck only two intentional boundaries  seriously   was when Mustafizur dismissed Nissanka with a cutter towards the end of the ninth over  Until that point  Sri Lanka s run rate was above 7 50  Afterwards  it was less than five  Hridoy s sixes Given how close the match was in the end  Towhid Hridoy s four sixes   all of them against Hasaranga   also had an impact  Three of them came back to back to back  at the start of the 12th over  The first two came off slog sweeps  and the third off a beautiful inside out shot over cover  Hasaranga would trap him lbw next ball  but Hridoy had already landed the important blows  It was these sixes that gave Bangladesh the room to stutter towards the end and still win with two wickets in hand and one over to spare
