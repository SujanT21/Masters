For much of T20 World Cup 2024  USA haven t looked out of place against any side  but West Indies were a class apart against them  A brilliant bowling performance from the spinners spearheaded by Roston Chase was followed up by a chase that was sledgehammer like in its brutality  Shai Hope crunched an unbeaten 82 off 39 balls  smashing eight sixes along the way as Nicholas Pooran helped him finish the game off with 55 balls and nine wickets to spare  By the end  the contest looked like the first real mismatch USA have been on the wrong side of as they ran out of ideas bowling to Hope  who until now had only played one match all tournament  He would reach his half century in just 26 balls   the fastest in T20 World Cup history for West Indies   before only speeding up after Jonathan Charles holed out  Pooran and Hope unleashed fire and fury towards the end as the game hurtled to an early finish  plundering the last 53 runs in just 14 deliveries  The game was set up  though  by a disciplined bowling performance led by the wily old hand of Chase  Not by any means West Indies  most glamorous spinner  Chase didn t even get to bat against England in the previous game  He showed his all round value with a statement performance  though  ripping through the USA s middle order and breaking the back of the innings  Akeal Hosein had played his customary role upfront  squeezing USA in the powerplay  while Andre Russell s three wickets helped the hosts continue to shackle USA whenever they tried to get a partnership going  The extra bounce Alzarri Joseph generated to dismiss Andries Gous just as he was beginning to whir into full gear ended up being the sliding doors moment for USA  who  in truth  were never close to competitive from that moment on  West Indies  meanwhile  are back with a bang  Gous  brief resistance It seems a long time ago  but for a short while in the second half of the powerplay in the first innings  it looked as if Gous   now the second highest scorer of this tournament   had turned the tide on West Indies  Halfway through  it was West Indies  powerplay  having conceded just 13 in the first three overs  But Gous  who nearly took USA home against South Africa with an unbeaten 80 off 47  stormed to a flier once more  punishing the length deliveries of Joseph to help plunder 35 off the final three of the powerplay  It helped USA put on 48 in the first six   their second highest powerplay score at this World Cup  But with large parts of the middle order misfiring since their early couple of wins  USA needed Gous to press on as he did in the previous game  So when he holed out off Joseph after a bright 16 ball 29  trouble brewed for the co hosts  Chase leads the West Indies rally West Indies did not allow USA to post a big score and take the game deep  they were chasing net run rate as well as points in Barbados  Once Joseph had cleared Gous from the path  Chase and Gudakesh Motie had free rein to run rings round the rest  A bit of extra turn did for Nitish Kumar  but it was the Chase show from there  Aaron Jones had just walloped a 101m six  but it didn t stop Chase bravely flighting the first ball of the spell up to him on the stumps  Jones missed and Chase cleaned him up  but it was the double strike in his third over that truly crippled USA  Corey Anderson s desperate run with the bat continued when he was trapped on the back pad plumb in front  before slowing the next one right up  duping Harmeet Singh into lobbing it up straight to point  Chase was wisely bowled out in one four over spell  with figures of 3 for 19 not flattering him in the slightest  It s Hope that kills USA off There were calls for Hope to be included in West Indies  starting line up right from the start  Instead  it s Brandon King s injury that paved the way for him to come in  and leaving him out suddenly feels even more perplexing  He lit up his home ground with a sizzling display  ensuring West Indies got ahead of the rate early  and from thereon the contest turned into a run rate salvage operation  No bowler was spared the brutality of his raw power  and when a heave over mid off cleared the rope  he brought up a scintillating half century  But Hope wasn t fading away  if anything he kicked it up a notch  smashing the hapless Milind Kumar for three consecutive sixes in the ninth over  priming West Indies to the sort of run rate boosting win they so badly needed
