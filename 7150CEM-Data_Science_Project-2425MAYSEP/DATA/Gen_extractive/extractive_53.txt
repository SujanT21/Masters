It was far from the confident start to the tournament that West Indies  co hosts of the T20 World Cup 2024  would have hoped to make  but in the end they avoided adding to an ignominious list of upsets in a format they once dominated  Papua New Guinea almost took the game to the final over  only for Roston Chase s unbeaten 42 off 27 to prove decisive in salvaging a nervy five wicket win in Providence  Guyana  When PNG captain Assad Vala dismissed Sherfane Rutherford at the end of the 16th over  West Indies were five down and needing 40 from the last 24 deliveries  The sight of Andre Russell walking out at No  7 was a reminder of what the Associate nation  playing in only their second T20 World Cup  were up against  however  Russell  an IPL winner with Kolkata Knight Riders a week ago  duly launched his fourth ball into the crowd to make the requirement 31 from 18  Chase then kicked up through the gears  having anchored the innings while wickets fell around him  West Indies  No  4  preferred in the side to Shimron Hetmyer  took a six and two fours off Vala in the 18th  before picking off Kabua Morea for back to back boundaries to bring the victory in sight  It meant that PNG  with former West Indies World Cup winning coach Phil Simmons looking on from their bench in his role of consultant  narrowly missed out on a first scalp at this level  Their best prospect had seemingly been to avoid embarrassment  after they reached the halfway point of their innings on 57 for 4  but Sese Bau s half century and a fighting lower order knock from Kiplin Doriga gave them something to bowl at  Had they chosen to review an appeal against Nicholas Pooran  who contributed 27 to the chase  before he had scored  West Indies  fragility might well have been exposed again  The review that wasn t Anyone who has followed West Indies  travails in ICC competitions recently   a dismal T20 World Cup defence in 2021  crashing out of a group featuring Ireland  Scotland and Zimbabwe in 2022  failure to even qualify for last year s 50 over World Cup   would have felt a familiar sense of trepidation creeping over them at the start of this run chase  Alei Nao struck with his first ball on World Cup debut  pinning Johnson Charles for a golden duck  then  as the rain started to fall  he nipped one fatefully back into the pads of Pooran  PNG opted not to review umpire Rashid Riaz s not out decision and were immediately made fully aware of their mistake as the players left the field for a 20 minute interruption  ball tracking showing that it would have hit the top of middle stump with enough certainty to be overturned  On the resumption  Nao completed a wicket maiden  and with Pooran struggling for rhythm it was only thanks to Brandon King finding regular boundaries   his first 28 runs came via seven fours   that West Indies were able to make headway  Pooran  on 5 from 15 balls  then launched Bau s offspin for 6 4 6 at the start of the sixth over  as West Indies surged to reach the end of the powerplay on 52 for 1  seemingly well placed  PNG spinners squeeze Despite that burst of aggression  Pooran never fully settled and did eventually become the second wicket to fall when he chipped John Kariko to long on at the start of the ninth  Vala then brought himself on to make it spin from both ends  with King s attempt to break the shackles ending in the hands of deep midwicket  Vala delivered the second wicket maiden of the innings  and West Indian nerves began to jangle again as they edged along to 77 for 3 at the end of the 13th  having scored 25 runs from 42 balls outside of the powerplay  West Indies captain  Rovman Powell  struck a much needed boundary off Chad Soper but was dismissed in the same over  despite confidently reviewing after being given out caught behind  Chase popped above the parapet to slog sweep Charles Amini for six   his first boundary coming from his 15th ball   but Vala then had Rutherford caught behind in the following over  Doriga clutching the ball between a combination of legs  gloves and body  to leave West Indies 97 for 5 and fighting to stave off a major upset  West Indies start like they mean it Everything went right initially for the co hosts  who were starting their campaign to win a third T20 title  Powell won the toss and chose to insert PNG for the morning start in Providence  noting the  inclement weather around and also a fresh wicket   Akeal Hosein opened the bowling and proceeded to concede just a single off the opening over  during which Tony Ura and Vala struggled to lay bat on ball  The scale of the challenge for PNG was clear  West Indies duly made inroads  Ura edging behind off Romario Shepherd in the second over before Lega Siaka was undone by his second legitimate delivery  Hosein swinging one back through the gate to hit middle and off  Although Vala found his feet after inching along to 5 off 10  stepping out to loft Chase for an imperious six  then smacking Alzarri Joseph for two fours in three balls  he fell to the last ball of the powerplay   Joseph exacting revenge thanks to Chase s brilliant diving catch   to leave PNG up against it at 34 for 3  Take a Bau Bau had struck the first boundary of day  driving Russell back down the ground in the fourth over  and he played assertively to steer his side away from disaster and towards a competitive total  A reverse sweep off Hosein also found the rope  before he skipped down to loft Chase through long off  Although Bau lost another partner when Hiri Hiri fell to Gudakesh Motie s fourth ball  caught at slip reverse sweeping  the subsequent fifth wicket stand of 44 with Amini was comfortably the biggest of the PNG innings  After a few overs of consolidation  Bau cut lose against Motie  hitting the spinner down the ground and over wide long on for four and six from consecutive deliveries  then adding another boundary through the covers to get PNG s run rate above a run a ball  A top edged four off Joseph took him to the brink of a half century  although he lost his partner before he could get there as Amini nicked behind cutting at Russell  Bau duly reached a 42 ball fifty at the start of the following over   the second by a PNG batter in T20 World Cups  and the second against a Full Member nation in T20Is   before being defeated by a Joseph slower ball to leave his side 98 for 6 in the 17th over  Doriga drags PNG up That PNG managed to add 38 from the last 21 balls of the innings was largely down to Doriga  as well as a sloppy finish from the West Indies attack  Doriga might have been dismissed for 1 off 6 balls  when a Joseph delivery clipped off stump without disturbing the bails  but the PNG wicketkeeper proceeded to combine hard running with the occasionally hearty thwack to finish unbeaten on 27 from 18  Shepherd  Russell and Joseph all leaked runs at the death  with the latter carved for back to back fours at the start of the 20th before overstepping with what should have been the final ball
