Suryakumar Yadav snatched a boundary catch for the ages  Jasprit Bumrah snuck in two electric final overs  and Hardik Pandya pilfered the two big wickets as India pulled off one of their great heists to win a World Cup  finally  With five overs to go  South Africa were rampant  Heinrich Klaasen  one of the great hitters in the game  threatening to throw off decades of painful big match history for his team with a hail of sixes  He and David Miller had clubbed 38 runs off the two previous overs  and with six wickets in hand South Africa needed only a run a ball off the last 30 balls  Rohit Sharma was forced to go to the best bowler in the world  when he would have otherwise saved Bumrah for later overs  Bumrah didn t quite break the partnership  the batters never daring to take him on  But he did break Klaasen and Miller s stride  They scrambled only four runs off that over  But the most telling blow  came at the start of the 17th over  After the flow of the game was further slowed due to an apparent knee complaint for Rishabh Pant  Hardik bowled a wide line outside off and took the edge of Klaasen  Pant snaffling the chance gleefully  Still  Miller was there  though he couldn t get a boundary away off the rest of that over  Then Bumrah came back  bowled several ripsnorters in the last over of yet another tournament he has dominated  With one of those magic balls  a wicked in seamer  he burst through the defenses of the last recognised South Africa batter  Marco Jansen  and grazed leg stump  With Keshav Maharaj now in the middle  their batting line up notably short  and 20 needed off 12 balls  South Africa were for the first time since the early overs of the chase in trouble  Arshdeep Singh delivered a nerveless 19th over  off which South Africa could muster only four  The dream killing blow came next  With 16 needed off the final over  bowled by Hardik  Miller tried to lift the first ball  a wide full toss  over the straight boundary  But he didn t connect perfectly  and Suryakumar  running full tilt along the rope  his feet only centimetres inside  caught the ball  popped it up as he briefly stepped over the boundary  then completed the running catch as he hopped back into the field  sparking wild jubilation in the stands  and ecstatic celebrations from the India players  South Africa batters No  8  9  and 10  did not manage to get Hardik away  aside from a single outside edge that flew for four  When Hardik India completed the seven run win  the bowler sank to his knees in relief  his team mates exulted  and the crowd  largely supporting India  flew into euphoria  Their team had become World Champions again  after 13 years  Bumrah s spectacular finals showing On a flat track in Barbados  Bumrah bowled two unplayable deliveries that brought him two wickets   both bowled  The first of these was the better one  It was one of the best in the tournament  and very arguably one of the best ever in finals  Angled in to Reeza Hendricks  it pitched and seamed away to hit the top of off  beating the batter s outside edge  He conceded five runs in that first over  eight runs in the next  one of only two boundaries off his bowling came here   a not fully controlled steer through deep third   But those last two overs went some distance to defining this match  Four runs off the 16th over  after the 15th had been clubbed for 24 runs  Two runs off the 17th  His figures were 2 for 18  Arshdeep plays his role Arshdeep Singh was almost as outstanding  returning 2 for 20  His two powerplay overs cost only eight  and brought the important wicket of Aiden Markram  who edged him behind  In the middle overs  he dismissed Quinton de Kock  who was looking to raise the tempo after he had overseen the recover after two early blows  And then that fantastic 19th over  in which he bowled two balls to Miller but conceded only three off them  otherwise keeping Maharaj on strike  This  after India s spinners had leaked 106 off their nine collective overs  Klaasen makes a six filled charge One of the best hits of the tournament was Klaasen crashing a wide  Kuldeep Yadav googly way over the cover boundary for six  with minimal foot movement  That was his third six  he d banged Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja over the rope earlier   But it was against Axar Patel that he really thumped South Africa into the ascendancy  First ball of the 15th over  he bullied down the ground off the back foot for four  Axar bowled two wides in fear  Then later  two massive hits down the ground   one of which pounded the roof of the stadium  then a four through wide long off for good measure  He completed his fifty off 23 balls  the fastest ever in a T20 World Cup final  After he was dismissed  South Africa could not manage a single intentional boundary  the only four coming off Kagiso Rabada s outside edge  Kohli drops anchor The headlines will say Virat Kohli top scored with 76 off 59  but there were times when this knock was laboured  Between the fourth and 18th over  Kohli faced 35 balls in which he scored 29 and hit no boundaries  When he got to fifty  he had used up 48 deliveries  and didn t raise his bat  having batted for most of that time in ODI middle overs mode  There was an obvious critique to make here  was this an innings so unambitious  it was actually doing India harm  But the counter argument is strong  Kohli had been 22 off 16 when the third wicket  Suryakumar Yadav  went down  in the fifth over  And the security he gave at one end  allowed Axar  pushed up the order No  5  and Shivam Dube to prosper with their big hitting  His stands with those batters reaped 72 off 54  Axar hit 47 off 31  and 57 off 33  Dube hit 22 off 13   and formed the heft of India s innings  Their 176 for 7 was the most any team has scored in a World Cup final  Did South Africa choke  For 35 overs of this game  you could not have possibly arrived at that conclusion  They were pumped up in the early overs  when Keshav Maharaj struck twice  and Rabada removed Suryakumar   India s most dangerous batter  They held their catches and were excellent in the outfield  They overcame losing early wickets nicely too  But at one point  they needed 26 off 24 balls  had six wickets in hand  and only one over of Bumrah left to face  They tried to target Hardik  which was the smart play in that situation  but lost both their key batters to him  There are simpler explanations too  India were battle hardened and skilful  South Africa s batting line up was short
