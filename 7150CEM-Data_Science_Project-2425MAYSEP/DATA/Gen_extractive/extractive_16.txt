New Zealand signed off a disappointing T20 World Cup 2024 campaign with a dominant win over Papua New Guinea  chasing down a paltry target of 79 with seven wickets and 46 balls to spare at the Brian Lara Stadium  in Tarouba  The scale of the mismatch was characterised by Lockie Ferguson s figures of 3 for 0 from his four overs  The New Zealand speedster became only the second bowler to bowl four maidens in a T20I fixture after Canada captain Saad Bin Zafar achieved the feat in 2021 when he returned 2 for 0 against Panama  While Ferguson was sharp and accurate  the moisture in the pitch and what remained in the air from the morning showers that delayed the toss by an hour made it a tough ask for PNG s batters  The weather was a primary reason Kane Williamson inserted the opposition upon winning the toss  who in turn were 16 for 2 after the powerplay  Charles Amini s 17  the highest score of the innings  came in the most productive stand   27 for the third wicket with Sese Bau   before he was pinned lbw for Ferguson s second of the innings  Trent Boult  playing in his last T20 World Cup match  went on to pocket two wickets when he returned to bowl his final two overs at the death  Ish Sodhi  replacing Jimmy Neesham in the XI for his first match of the competition  also picked up a brace  taking the final PNG wickets in the 20th over as they were bowled out with two balls left in their innings  But PNG were not about to bow out without a fight  Kabua Morea  returning to the XI after playing the opener against West Indies  removed Finn Allen  caught behind  off the second delivery of New Zealand s innings  He then pocketed Rachin Ravindra when the left hander tried and failed to lift beyond deep midwicket at the start of the fifth over  Further excitement on the field came when Semo Kamea trapped Devon Conway on the crease  His 35   which included two fours and three sixes   had  however  taken the sting out of the chase  Conway and Williamson added 34 runs for the third wicket   New Zealand s highest partnership of the tournament  Williamson and Daryl Mitchell then completed the formalities  scoring the remaining 25 runs from 18 balls to earn New Zealand their second win  consigning PNG to a fourth defeat  Ferguson in the record books It began with a wicket  extra pace across Assad Vala that enticed a drive  There was even a bit of extra bounce which only served to make Mitchell s catch at a wide first slip that little bit tougher  From that point on  Ferguson was locked in  Did he know a place in the record books was in the offing  Probably not  But the movement through the air and off the deck  not to mention the high pace that was always going to ask unanswerable questions to a limited PNG batting line up  meant Ferguson was likely to emerge with extraordinary figures  The 33 year old was primarily over the wicket to the left handed Bau  who entered the fray upon Vala s dismissal  Having switched to over the wicket midway through his second over  the seventh   Ferguson returned for the 12th from that angle and was immediately rewarded with a delivery into Amini s pads that skidded on with the angle so sharply it was initially given not out on the field  DRS corrected that error before Ferguson took matters into his own hands by hitting Chad Soper s stumps for his third  Then came two leg byes down to deep third   which did not count against the bowler   and the final three deliveries  which were counted down by those in the commentary box  now fully invested in witnessing history  Kiplin Doriga s mistimed pull almost broke the streak   though it also could have resulted in a catch at mid off   before the right hander charged Ferguson s final delivery to no avail  Ferguson looked a little sheepish as his team mates filed over to congratulate him  Nevertheless  a forgettable T20 World Cup now has a memorable sidenote  PNG batters leave unfulfilled As valiant as PNG s displays have been at their second T20 World Cup  there is good reason to look at their batting and wonder what might have been  Particularly when Allen and Ravindra were snared early  Signing off with a score of 78  following totals of 95 against Afghanistan and 77 versus Uganda  highlights the limitations of their batters  Even the 136 for 8 against West Indies looked light at the halfway stage  having faced 55 dot balls when setting that evening in Guyana  Even discounting the 23 scoreless deliveries off Ferguson  they failed to find a run from the 58 balls delivered by the rest of the New Zealand attack  Conditions were not kind to batters throughout  particularly those taking guard against the new ball duo of Boult and Tim Southee on a new track with variable bounce  but more intent could have been shown  Particularly against Mitchell Santner  The left arm spinner floated plenty up but conceded just one boundary  Perhaps spooked by Bau lifting Santner into the hands of long on  it took until Santner s final delivery for someone to land one on him  as Doriga smeared a sweep shot to midwicket for four  Of course  this match does not really qualify as a missed opportunity given New Zealand s undoubted superiority  But it did serve as a reminder of the shortcomings that cost them victory against Uganda and allowed West Indies off the hook  Kabua Morea s redemption It was 15 days between appearances at this T20 World Cup for Morea  The left arm seamer started against West Indies  arriving into the match with the expectation he would be a crutch for the attack over the coming fortnight  He ended up with figures of 0 for 30 from three overs  the last of which went for 13 as Roston Chase profited off a couple of full tosses to take the hosts over the line with an over to spare  Morea spent the next two matches on the sidelines as PNG opted for a more spin heavy attack  Conditions dictated as much  but Morea would have every reason to consider himself an unfortunate casualty of this shift having been the side s leading wicket taker at the 2021 edition  But here in Tarouba  he seized the opportunity to leave the World Cup on something of a high  returning home with figures of 2 for 4 from 2 2 overs  Allen s hot headed hack gave him a wicket with the second ball  And having tied Ravindra down for the rest of that first over  the Kiwi No 3 greeted his reintroduction for the fifth over with a desperate charge and swipe that nestled into the hands of Kamea in the deep  It was at this point that the rain made a return  New Zealand were 20 for 2  level with the five over par score  which they passed when Williamson punched a single off his first ball  It was the only run off the over  with Morea boasting figures of 2 for 2 from his first two overs  As it turned out the rain did not stop play  either  While not as headline grabbing as Ferguson s exploits  Morea s 11 dots against an engaging and far more equipped New Zealand batting line up were equally impressive
