Jonathan Trott first kicked a bag in the dressing room  He then signaled to Afghanistan to slow the game down when rain was around  Rashid Khan had his hands on his head at various moments in the chase  Mohammad Nabi had a constant smile on his face  Dwayne Bravo wasn t able to watch it  But the one moment that encapsulated the emotionally charged night in Kingstown was Naveen ul Haq taking off after taking the final Bangladesh wicket  That sealed Afghanistan s maiden spot in the semi final of any men s senior World Cup  In a match that had a start stop nature owing to multiple rain interventions  Afghanistan   led by four fors from Naveen and Rashid   edged out Bangladesh by a mere eight runs  and in the process  also knocked Australia out of the T20 World Cup 2024  Both teams  along with Australia  were in contention for one semi final spot from Group 1 of Super Eight  and the rain only added to the drama  For the best part of the last hour  a cat and mouse game ensued  There were moments when Bangladesh edged Afghanistan out on the DLS par score  only for the latter to come back to snatch back the advantage by picking up wickets  Litton Das  with a best of 36 before Monday in the tournament  stayed through it all  but couldn t take Bangladesh over the line  Rashid and Co  danced their hearts out after knocking two teams with a single blow  and the celebrations are only likely to go on for longer  The drama after the second rain interval Bangladesh had to chase their original target of 116 down in 12 1 overs to pip both Australia and Afghanistan to the semi final  Their chase was delayed by half an hour  thanks to a 20 minute downpour  A shorter game  therefore  was disadvantageous to Bangladesh  After the second rain break  though  Bangladesh sent out mixed signals  Litton attacked Naveen but Soumya Sarkar fell in a bid to do so against Rashid  Towhid Hridoy s risks against Mohammad Nabi  which included a dropped catch  came off but he  too  holed out off Rashid  But with Litton hitting Rashid for successive fours   first over mid off and then just past slip   Bangladesh looked on track to hunt the target down to qualify  But soon  Mahmudullah s indecisiveness and Rishad Hossain s adventurousness meant they slipped to 80 for 7 after 11 overs  Which is when the rainy clouds returned to continuously hover around the stadium  and constantly brought the DLS par scores into picture for the rest of the night  In the face of increasing pressure  Litton seemingly kept his calm  He has had a forgettable 2024 in T20Is  striking at under 100 and his place in the Bangladesh set up under scanner  But he started off with intent and kept up their hopes of signing off from the T20 World Cup with a win  But it was not meant to be  Naveen s new ball burst bursts Bangladesh Fazalhaq Farooqi  Afghanistan s weapon with the new ball  trapped Tanzid Hasan lbw with his third ball  making it his 16th wicket  which drew him equal with Wanindu Hasaranga for most wickets in a men s T20 World Cup  Naveen s first over was expensive  with Litton hitting him for a four and a six  Then Najmul Hossain Shanto heaved one over midwicket in his second over  But with a deep midwicket in place  Naveen once again bowled a length ball angling into Shanto  who picked out the fielder there  Naveen then got the next ball to straighten just enough to catch Shakib Al Hasan s leading edge for a return catch and Bangladesh were 23 for 3  Afghanistan steady but slow One of the methods that has worked for Afghanistan  and their openers  in this World Cup is a non enterprising start  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran stayed true to form  taking very few chances inside the powerplay as well as in the first ten overs  They finished the powerplay on 27 for 0 and at the ten over mark were 58 for 0  It was Gurbaz and Ibrahim s fourth fifty partnership  the most by any pair in a T20 World Cup  In the first ten overs  there were only 15 attempts of attacking shots  that too on a surface that was slowing down and was going to see dew later on  Rishad leads Bangladesh squeeze When Rishad was brought on in the ninth over  the wind was blowing diagonally from right to left  in the direction of his natural spin  He immediately beat Ibrahim s outside edge  and in his second over used the bounce on offer to get the same batter s leading edge caught at long off  Gurbaz then took the attack to Rishad in his third over  He first slapped one over cover point to end a phase of 38 legal balls without a four  and then used the sweep for another four through backward square leg region  However  Rishad had the last laugh when he had Gurbaz holing out to deep cover in his last over  A couple of balls later  he also had Gulbadin Naib miscue a slice towards cover point  Naib could have gotten away if not for Sarkar  who sprinted in from the deep and dived forward almost near the 30 metre circle  And just like that  Afghanistan had ceded early advantage to slip from 59 for 0 to 89 for 4  The Rashid intervention Rashid walked in at 93 for 5 with just 14 balls left  He faced ten of those  attempted attacking shots on nine of those  and finished on 19 not out  He struck three sixes  two of those in the last over bowled by Tanzim Hasan Sakib  He used good use of the willow generally  except on one occasion when he flung it towards his partner  Karim Janat  It was the last over of the innings and Rashid wanted a second run to retain strike but Janat refused it  Still  he helped Afghanistan score 22 in the last 14 balls that helped them to a total they could fight with  just as the heavens in Kingstown opened up  Afghanistan faced 66 dot balls in their innings  which was the third most by a team with five or fewer wickets lost in men s T20I where ball by ball records are available with ESPNcricinfo  But it did not come back to haunt Afghanistan  who kept a clean slate of successfully defending totals in St Vincent
