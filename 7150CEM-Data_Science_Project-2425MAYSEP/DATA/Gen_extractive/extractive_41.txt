Afghanistan boosted their Super Eight chances with yet another dominating win  this time thumping New Zealand by 84 runs in Providence  Having beaten Uganda by 125 runs in their opening match  they are now at the top of Group C with a net run rate of 5 225  After being sent in  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran gave Afghanistan a start of 103 in 14 3 overs  It came off the back of the 154 the pair added against Uganda  thus making them the first opening pair to register two successive century stands in the history of the T20 World Cup  Afghanistan s was an innings of two halves  They scored 55 for no loss in the first ten overs and 104 for 6 in the last ten  with Gurbaz contributing 80 off 56 balls  New Zealand  who had decided not to play any warm up games  looked every bit rusty as their fielders dropped catches and missed run out opportunities  With the pitch assisting both seamers and spinners  chasing 160 was not going to be easy  But few would have expected New Zealand to collapse in the manner they did  Fazalhaq Farooqi picked up three wickets in the powerplay and Rashid Khan three just after it  Eventually  both ended with identical figures of 4 for 17 as New Zealand were bowled out for 75 in the 15 2 overs  Glenn Phillips and Matt Henry were the only New Zealand batters to reach the double digits  Afghanistan s shaky start Trent Boult found some swing in the opening over but Gurbaz and Ibrahim showed their intent by picking up three fours off Henry from the other end  Both batters had luck on their side  too  Gurbaz got a second life when he skipped down the track to Santner and missed the ball  which went on to brush the leg stump but the bails did not budge  In the following over  Finn Allen dropped Ibrahim off Henry at the deep square leg boundary  That was not all  Gurbaz got another reprieve after being involved in a miscommunication with Ibrahim  Having taken off for a single  Gurbaz had to retrace his steps and would have been run out had Conway not fumbled the throw  Two balls later  New Zealand finally seemed to have found success when Santner pinged Ibrahim s pads and umpire Kumar Dharmasena ruled it lbw  But the batter got the decision overturned on review as the ball was heading down the leg side  Immediately after that  Ibrahim hit Santner for an inside out four as Afghanistan ended the powerplay on 44 for no loss  Bracewell  Ferguson put the brakes on New Zealand went against the prevailing wisdom of not bowling an offspinner when two right hand batters at the crease  and Michael Bracewell repaid that faith by conceding only six off his first two overs  Lockie Ferguson was even more frugal  going for five in his first two  He could have had Ibrahim off a slower full toss but a leaping Kane Williamson failed to pull off a one handed stunner at mid off  That meant while Afghanistan remained unscathed  they had only 55 on the board after ten overs  The acceleration Afghanistan had not hit a single six in the first ten overs  but there were five in the next three  including three in one Bracewell over as Gurbaz and Bracewell stepped on the accelerator  The pair took the side past 100 in the 14th over  New Zealand finally broke through when Ibrahim bottom edged a short ball from Henry onto his stumps  after having been hit on the grille on the previous delivery  Promoted to No  3  Azmatullah Omarzai played his part with 22 off 13  which included two sixes in three balls off Henry  Mohammad Nabi fell for a first ball duck but Gurbaz kept finding the boundary at regular intervals  However  a three wicket  three run final over by Boult kept Afghanistan to 159  Farooqi rocks New Zealand early Farooqi gave Afghanistan a dream start with the ball  With the very first delivery of the innings  he uprooted Finn Allen s leg stump as the ball moved in late  In the seamer s next over  Conway pushed at one that seemed to come slower off the surface and was caught at extra cover  The decision to give Farooqi a third over in the powerplay brought further rewards  This time  bowling around the wicket to Daryl Mitchell  he got a length delivery to just straighten and take the outside edge  Gurbaz took a regulation catch to complete the dismissal and leave New Zealand 28 for 3  It could have been worse for New Zealand  In between  Naveen ul Haq had rapped Kane Williamson s front pad after the batter had moved across to play a delivery  Afghanistan sent it upstairs for an lbw review but the umpire s call saved the New Zealand captain  Rashid joins the party Afghanistan did not have to wait too long for Williamson s wicket  Rashid brought himself on after the powerplay and struck straightaway as Williamson guided one to first slip  But Rashid was just warming up  In his next over  he dismissed Mark Chapman and Bracewell off successive deliveries to leave New Zealand on 43 for 6  Chapman went for a pull and got bowled  Bracewell was late to bring his bat down and was lbw  Phillips was New Zealand s last hope  He did hit a couple of boundaries but was soon caught at long on when he tried to take on Nabi  That ended any hopes of revival New Zealand might have had
