Afghanistan booked their place in Super Eight  thereby knocking New Zealand out of men s T20 World Cup 2024  after a seven wicket win over PNG in Tarouba  Their win was set up by new ball spells from fast bowlers Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen ul Haq that saw PNG lose five wickets inside the powerplay  A total of four run outs did not help PNG s cause either as they were dismissed for 95  Afghanistan romped home with 29 balls to spare with Gulbadin Naib staying unbeaten on 49  The result meant that for the first time since 2014  New Zealand bowed out before the semi final stage of a men s World Cup   ODI or T20  With six points and a net run rate of 4 230  Afghanistan lead Group C  Naib douses a brief spark from PNG A target of 96 would not have worried Afghanistan  Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran had added century stands for the opening wicket in each of their first two games  Gurbaz had struck fifties in those outings  As a result  the middle order had barely had time in the middle  On Thursday  Afghanistan s worst fears nearly came true  Semo Kamea  brought in for vice captain Charles Amini  almost struck first ball when Ibrahim was ruled out lbw  He used the DRS to his benefit but lost his stumps three balls later while trying to attack an inswinger from Kamea  In the next over  fast bowler Alei Neo knocked over Gurbaz  who also charged down to heave one across the line  PNG could have put even more pressure on Afghanistan had wicketkeeper Kiplin Doriga hung on to Naib s outside edge in the fifth over  PNG were left to rue those chances on a surface with dry grass  which  as Daren Ganga had said in his pitch report  contributed to variable bounce  The proof was in Azmatullah Omarzai s dismissal when a length ball from Norman Vanua barely got up and bowled him  But Naib  in the company of Mohammad Nabi  countered the conditions to ensure Afghanistan faced no further hiccups  Vala run out triggers collapse PNG made almost the right start after being sent in  A double through fine leg  a single through point  a cut shot for four   they were ticking along without any risk  But it all went south when captain Assad Vala was run out in the second over  Going for the third run  his bat was in the air at the non striker s end when Gurbaz nailed a direct hit at the bowler s end  Had Vala slid his bat  he would have been safe  Farooqi then did what he does best  flummox batters with swing  He had Lega Siaka caught behind by Gurbaz diving full length to his right and then  on the next ball  Sese Bau also nicked one behind  When Naveen got Hiri Hiri to chop one onto his stumps on the first ball of the fourth over  PNG had lost four wickets in nine balls  Batting first on a used surface that hosted the West Indies New Zealand clash just 24 hours ago  that was handing over advantage on a platter  Doriga leads mini recovery for PNG When Naveen crashed through Tony Ura for his 50th T20I wicket  PNG were reduced to 30 for 5  PNG needed to bat a few overs safely at that point  and Chad Soper and Doriga did that for 24 balls while scoring 16 runs  But in the tenth over  both were guilty of ball watching  which resulted in Soper being run out  Doriga then used the slog sweep and sweep to rotate strike against Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad  Neo punished the seamers when they bowled on his pads  The pair was effective without being enterprising and added 38 off 34 balls  Once Doriga was done in by a wrong un from Noor to be trapped lbw  PNG lost their last three wickets for just seven runs
