Another game  another close one for South Africa and they seem to be making a habit of sneaking over the line at the T20 World Cup 2024  This time  they were pushed by USA  who gave an excellent account of themselves in their first Super Eight match  On a batter friendly pitch  USA kept South Africa to under 200 from 126 for 1 in the 13th over  Quinton de Kock s first half century of the tournament set South Africa up  before Saurabh Netravalkar and Harmeet Singh took 3 for 15 between them  but the rest of the attack could not provide enough support  Heinrich Klaasen and Tristan Stubbs shared a fifth wicket partnership of 53 to give South Africa a competitive total to defend  USA were off to a bright start thanks to Steven Taylor but Kagiso Rabada s double strike in the Powerplay kept things even  Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi squeezed USA through the middle but South African born Andries Gous very nearly had a decisive say on proceedings  His unbeaten 80 and his 91 run stand with Harmeet   the second highest for the sixth wicket or lower in all T20 World Cups   took USA to within 28 runs of victory  with two overs left  Ultimately  Rabada and Anrich Nortje kept USA at bay and South Africa earned their first Super Eight points  Only a matter of time for de Kock It had to be  After scores of 20  0  18 and 10  de Kock  in what could be his last international assignment  finally brought out the big guns  He didn t hit South Africa s first boundary   that was Reeza Hendricks  six over cover   and waited until the fourth over before he properly got hold of one but when he did  he did not stop  De Kock pulled Jasdeep Singh through midwicket and then hit him for three successive sixes  all with the wind into the leg side  Jasdeep s first over cost 28 runs  just 10 fewer than South Africa s highest Powerplay of the tournament before this match  and set them up for a score of 64 for 1 at the end of the fielding restrictions  De Kock went on to bring up fifty with a six off Corey Anderson  off the 26th ball he faced and to his highest T20 World Cup score  74  Catching on point  The bowling  Not always  USA s fielding got them back into the game from Anderson s excellent judgement to take a skier off Hendricks  top edge in the third over to Shayan Jahangir judging his distance from the boundary rope well at cow corner to end de Kock s knock  But it was Ali Khan  who dived forward as he ran in from the deep backward point fence and held on to the grab that could have changed the innings  Aiden Markram was on 46 and hit the last ball of the 15th over in Ali s direction  He took a stunner to deny South Africa s captain the chance to push the score above 200  Despite all that  USA still gave away 53 runs in the last five overs and will not be entirely happy with some of their bowling  While Netravalkar and Harmeet s eight overs cost just 45 runs with four wickets and only four fours  the other five bowlers delivered 12 overs for 148 runs  took no wickets and gave away nine fours and 10 sixes  Rabada roars back Rabada has operated somewhat in the shadows in the group stage of the T20 World Cup and took just four wickets for 84 runs in four matches  With South Africa looking at using two specialist spinners  the debate ahead of this match was which of the three seamers to leave out  On form  both Nortje and Ottneil Baartman made strong cases to stay in the XI ahead of Rabada but the decision was made to leave Baartman out in favour of Rabada s experience  He repaid that call by removing an aggressive looking Taylor with his third ball  in the fourth over  and seemed to be ramping up his pace as his spell developed  In his next over  Rabada had Nitish Kumar caught at deep square leg off a length ball on the pads and put South Africa in front with USA 53 for 2 after the Powerplay  He came back to bowl the penultimate over  with USA needing 28 runs off the last 12 balls and broke the partnership that threatened to take the game away  Gous and Harmeet shared a sixth wicket stand of 91 before Harmeet hit a Rabada full toss to Stubbs at midwicket and departed  along with USA s hopes  Gous gets a hold of some of home Welkom s Andries Gous is from the same place as Dean Elgar and was part of the group of South Africans who took up offers to play in the Minor League just as the Covid 19 pandemic hit  He made his international debut three months ago and relished the chance to play against the country of his birth and let them have it  He gave himself some time to get his eye in and hit his first boundary off the sixth ball he faced  off Rabada  He sent Marco Jansen for six over long on and then laid into Nortje  18 runs off the last four balls of his third over  That included back to back sixes  the second was over midwicket and also brought up Gous  half century  off 33 balls  But he saved the best for the 18th over  when he hit Shamsi for successive sixes to keep USA in the game  They needed 50 from the last three overs and then just 28 off the last two  Gous finished unbeaten on a career best 80
