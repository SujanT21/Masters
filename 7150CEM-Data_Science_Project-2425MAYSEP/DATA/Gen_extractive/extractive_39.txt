South Africa made heavy weather of a modest chase in New York before David Miller and Tristan Stubbs dug deep to save them from a third straight defeat at Netherlands  hands at an ICC tournament  Miller and Stubbs added 65 for the fifth wicket to lift them from the pits of 12 for 4 on a pitch that didn t play anywhere as badly as the scorecard suggested  even though there was enough in it for quick bowlers   13 of the 15 wickets fell to them  while there were two run outs  As he walked out to bat  Miller might have had a flashback of Adelaide 2022  where his wicket  with 47 needed off 28 balls  shut the door on South Africa and gave Netherlands a 13 run win  On Saturday  Miller stayed the course and remained unbeaten on 59  flicking on his best six hitting self in the penultimate over with South Africa needing 16 off 12  In the end  in a game where 209 runs were scored in 38 5 overs  South Africa won with enough to spare  The South African meltdown Quinton de Kock was run out without facing a ball  Reeza Hendricks got a peach from Logan van Beek that angled in and straightened to hit the top of off  Vivian Kingma had the first of a double when he strangled Aiden Markram down leg to leave South Africa 3 for 3  And when Heinrich Klaasen s rush of blood had him picking out Tim Pringle attempting a pull off Kingma  Netherlands dared to dream   or maybe just expected the expected  considering the recent results between the two sides at ICC events  Miller and Stubbs take over Both Miller and Stubbs are instinctive batters who love taking the bowlers on  But the situation they walked out to was not for that sort of batting  it was a crisis  A mis step could have meant curtains  So they chose caution  saw off the powerplay without any further damage  and hit only a further two boundaries until the ten over mark to leave South Africa needing 72 off the last ten overs  Stubbs was on 9 off 21 at this point  struggling to force the pace  especially when the ball was dug in to the pitch  A hint of grip for the spinners also made it difficult for him to hit out  So when Bas de Leede came on in the 11th  Stubbs gave him the charge and enjoyed a massive slice of luck as a thick inside edge flew wide of the midwicket fielder  Miller  too  rode some luck  A big hit down the ground off left arm spinner Pringle only just eluded the long on fielder in the 12th over with South Africa still needing 57 off 50  Stubbs finally shrug off the pressure that had built around him with a hoick for six off Vikramjit Singh  and then launched van Beek down the ground three balls later to turn the tide South Africa s way  Miller lands the finishing blows It should have been a smooth ride from there  with South Africa needing 29 off 30  But there was another twist  First  Paul van Meekeren delivered a maiden over to Miller  and the pressure showed when Stubbs holed out to deep midwicket in the next  off Bas de Leede  Then  in the 18th  van Beek came back after being walloped for six by Miller to dismiss Marco Jansen  But  with South Africa needing 16 off 12  de Leede erred in line  Miller began the penultimate over by dispatching a half tracker over fine leg  and then finished the game with a sequence of 2  0  4 and 6   cue a roar and wild fist pumping  Miller had tamed the demons of Adelaide 2022  Engelbrecht props up Netherlands Sybrand Engelbrecht  who represented South Africa at the Under 19 World Cup in 2008 and only recently made his Netherlands  debut  top scored with a 45 ball 40 on surface where the next best among the top seven was 12  At the toss  Netherlands were put in to bat seemingly because South Africa wanted to exploit the morning conditions  and had them tottering at 32 for 4  South Africa s four pronged pace attack  led by Marco Jansen  was breathing fire at that stage  with pace and bounce off the pitch for assistance  South Africa s hostility didn t end there  with Ottneil Baartman and Anrich Nortje ensuring there weren t any freebies  This resulted in Netherlands attempting to manufacture strokes  like Scott Edwards did when he executed a reverse scoop for six  but they simply didn t have enough  It came down to Englebrecht s patient knock and his 54 run association with van Beek to get them into three figures  It would have been inadequate on most days  but Netherlands can give themselves a pat on the back for making a match out of it to keep Group D very open
