Now  they ve  almost  done it all  After an undefeated streak of six matches  five of them far too close for comfort  South Africa have survived a rain reduced match and successfully chased a tricky target to book the spot in the semi final of the men s T20 World Cup 2024  They knocked co hosts West Indies out in the process and have topped their Super Eight group  which means they are also likely to avoid India in the final four  We ll say it again  is this their time  All the evidence points to a change of fortunes for a team that has so long coveted an ICC trophy and equally long  been denied  South Africa are now winning games they should be losing  scrapping like their rugby counterparts  the Springboks   who won the quarterfinals  semifinals and final  each by one point last year   and finding ways to overcome pressure  There s a new found tenacity to them and it s seen them get to a T20 World Cup knockout for the first time in a decade  Incidentally  when they got to the final four in the 2014 tournament  Aiden Markram had just led the Under 19 team to the World Cup  Now  he finds himself captaining the senior side and he is doing differently and to great success  Markram took the new ball in this match  and bowled himself for a full quota of four overs  He decided to rely on a non traditional strength  spin  South Africa had never bowled this many overs of spin in a T20 World Cup match  and only bowled more twice before against Sri Lanka in 2021  and the change of tack worked a charm  Between them  South Africa s spinners took 5 for 79 in 12 overs  They were largely responsible for keeping West Indies quiet and for several of the 57 dot balls West Indies faced in their innings   the equivalent of 9 3 overs   and the most at this T20 World Cup  Only an 81 run stand between Kyle Mayers and Roston Chase kept West Indies in the game  and they were the only two batters to get an individual score of more than 15  And once the tears have dried  West Indies will look to their batting as the major reason they were unable to advance  Their bowlers worked with what they had and had South Africa 15 for 2 in two overs  before the rain came down  They kept at and removed all the recognised batters  Chase s 3 for 12 and Joseph s 2 for 25 meant South Africa were always on tenterhooks but at seven down  Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen took it home  Markram gets funky but fielding gets messy An eventful first 10 overs saw South Africa drop four catches and Markram become just the second South Africa spinner to bowl four successive overs after opening the bowling in a men s T20I  and that was with two specialist spinners in the XI  Markram shared the new ball with Jansen  and got a wicket with his first ball  as South Africa won the early exchanges with West Indies 5 for 2 early on  They should have had a third in Jansen s next over  when Chase  on 12  swiped across the line and hit it straight up  Anrich Nortje had all the time in the world and got under it but could not hold on  Chase added eight more runs and then slog swept Keshav Maharaj to deep midwicket where David Miller could not contend with the aerial ball and the wind and let a difficult chance slip  Then  Maharaj was at square leg when Mayers  on 13  swept to him and he put it down  But the worst of the lot  from a visual perspective  was when Mayers hit Markram down the ground  Rabada and Jansen converged on the ball and didn t call and collided into each other  Jansen had to leave the field but returned and Markram finished with 1 for 28 from his four overs  Missing  KG Rabada The success of South Africa s spinners meant Markram had no use of Rabada until the 18th over  making it the latest he has ever bowled in this format  Rabada had played 62 T20Is before this one and had bowled in the first four overs in 61 previous instances  The latest he has bowled before was in the fifth over   also against West Indies   in 2021  He has once before been introduced after the halfway stage  in the 11th over in IPL 2021  So this was different but still  he had an almost immediate impact  Rabada had seen enough to know pace off was the best option and his first delivery  to Akeal Hosein  could only be dabbed to short third  Hosein and Andre Russell ran but Anrich Nortje picked up and threw quicker and Russell was run out  Later in the over  Hosein hit a cutter straight back to Rabada  who took a simple catch  His first over cost only one run and held West Indies back from a late surge  He closed out with an over worth 11 runs to keep West Indies to 135  It s South Africa in a virtual World Cup knockout   did you need more drama  Yes  yes  you did  And it delivered  Quinton de Kock took 12 runs off the opening over to get the chase underway but then Russell got hold of the new ball  He strangled Reeza Hendricks down the leg side with his first ball   though the decision needed to be reviewed and reversed after Snicko confirmed the edge   and the had de Kock well caught by Sherfane Rutherford at deep backward square  But that was not where the early tension ended  At the end of that over  the heavens opened and an almighty shower came down  bringing with it memories of  1992  2003  2015 and many other rain affected matches that South Africans would prefer to forget  The delay lasted 75 minutes and three overs were lost  reducing the target to 123  Klaasen puts South Africa in front We all know T20 matches can change in an over but in a rain reduced match  that is even more amplified  Heinrich Klaasen provided the game changing passage of play when he took on Gudakesh Motie and broke the back of the chase to put South Africa on course for victory  Klaasen hit Motie s first ball into the stands and the last three for successive fours  albeit risky  He stayed on the back foot and hit Motie aerially towards Chase  who could not reach the chance despite a full stretched dive at backward point  then glanced him past short fine and edged it past Nicholas Pooran to leave South Africa needing 53 runs off 10 overs and clear the path to the semi finals
