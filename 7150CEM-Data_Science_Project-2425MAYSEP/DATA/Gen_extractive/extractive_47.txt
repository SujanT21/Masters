New York s second match as a T20I venue was a lot like its first  low scoring and brutal  Two days after South Africa bowled Sri Lanka out for 77 here  India bowled Ireland out for 96  A different strip was used for this game  but the bounce was just as inconsistent  and batting just as difficult  if not outright dangerous  India s selection was spot on   they picked four fast bowlers including Hardik Pandya  and two spin bowling allrounders to lengthen their batting  which meant they left Kuldeep Yadav on the bench  They didn t need all that batting in the end  as Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant helped them cross the line with 46 balls remaining  but the packed pace attack proved extremely useful  Arshdeep Singh  Mohammed Siraj  Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik picked up 8 for 81 between them  extracting seam movement and up and down bounce right through an Ireland innings that lasted just 16 overs  As good as those performances were  though  this match will be remembered for the conditions  Batters from both teams took body blows   Rohit retired hurt on 52  soon after being struck on the arm   and by the time India wrapped up their win  their thoughts may have gone ahead to June 9 at the same venue  and what kind of pitch they may have to play Pakistan on  Arshdeep sets the tone The first two overs gave enough of a clue of how this pitch would behave  with both Arshdeep and Siraj extracting inconsistent bounce  One ball from Arshdeep   seam up rather than a slower ball or cutter   bounced a second time before reaching wicketkeeper Pant  but most of the inconsistency was up rather than down  with one ball forcing Pant into a leaping  overhead  goalkeeper style save  Extra bounce brought India their first wicket  Paul Stirling top edging a heave across the line at the start of the third over  By the end of that over  Arshdeep had taken out both openers  He was finding ways to mix up his stock inswinger to the right hander with balls that kept going with the left armer s angle across them  and one of these away slanters bowled Andy Balbirnie  as he stayed leg side of the ball and tried to steer one down to third  Ireland collapse By the end of the powerplay  Ireland were still only two down  but Harry Tector had already been hit on the glove and the thigh pad and was batting on 1 off 10  That became 4 off 15 before a nasty short ball from Bumrah hurried him  and he ended up gloving the attempted pull into his helmet and then to the fielder at short extra cover  By then they had also lost Lorcan Tucker  bowled trying to drive a nip backer from Hardik  India kept getting the length ball to nip around and the short of length ball to climb  and Ireland kept losing wickets  Even the introduction of spin didn t stem the collapse  as Barry McCarthy was caught and bowled by an Axar Patel ball that stuck in the pitch  At 50 for 8  Ireland were in danger of falling short of their lowest T20I total   68 against West Indies during the 2010 edition of this tournament  They eventually crossed that mark  with Gareth Delany s risk taking coming off   where that of his team mates  mostly didn t   in a 14 ball 26 that carried Ireland to 96  Rohit and Pant finish the job Rohit and Virat Kohli came out swinging   perhaps they reckoned that the new ball and powerplay field restrictions gave them the best chance of quick runs   and came away with contrasting outcomes  Kohli fell early  caught on the deep third boundary while charging at Mark Adair and looking to slap him over the covers  Rohit enjoyed two slices of early luck   Balbirnie put down a tough chance at second slip in the first over  off Adair  and an inside edge in the second over  off Josh Little  ran away for four past the stumps   and carried on to score his 30th T20I fifty  The pitch remained treacherous  and Rohit s control percentage hovered in the 40s for most of his innings  before climbing to 51 by the time he retired hurt  But he hit some telling blows too  most notably two trademark pulls off successive balls from Little that brought up his 599th and 600th sixes in international cricket  Before that  he also went past 4000 runs in T20Is  Pant looked more fluent than Rohit  indeed as fluent as anyone could have looked on this pitch  and hit three sixes and two fours while scoring an unbeaten 36 off 26  He took a hit to the elbow and one to the shoulder  and his response to the latter blow summed him up as a cricketer and character  he finished the match off the next ball  reverse scooping McCarthy for six over the wicketkeeper
