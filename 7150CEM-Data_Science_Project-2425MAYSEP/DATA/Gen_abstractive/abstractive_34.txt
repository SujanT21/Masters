South Africa survived an almighty scare to maintain a 100  win record at the T20 World Cup 2024. Aiden Markram decided to put a total on the board  and it almost looked like a mistake. A record 79 run fifth wicket stand between Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller took them to 113. Bangladesh fell short by four runs and their inability to capitalise on Keshav Maharaj bowling the final over cost them the game. South Africa leave the USA with three wins from three matches and will move to St  Vincent to play Nepal in their last group match.
