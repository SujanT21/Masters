Afghanistan knocked New Zealand out of men s T20 World Cup 2024 after a seven wicket win over PNG in Tarouba. Their win was set up by new ball spells from fast bowlers Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen ul Haq that saw PNG lose five wickets inside the powerplay. A total of four run outs did not help PNG s cause either as they were dismissed for 95. Afghanistan romped home with 29 balls to spare with Gulbadin Naib staying unbeaten on 49.
