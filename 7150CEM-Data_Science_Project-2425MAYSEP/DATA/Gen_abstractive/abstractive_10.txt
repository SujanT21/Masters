South Africa beat England in thrilling encounter to remain unbeaten in T20 World Cup 2024. South Africa didn't seem to have enough runs having scored 63 in the powerplay but only 100 in the next 14 overs. They seemed to have got their selection slightly wrong by picking only one specialist spinner who they had bowled out by the 13th over of England s chase. Their quicks did not appear to have fully bought into pace off  giving away 52 runs in three overs between the 15th and 17th over to leave England needing only 25 runs off the last 18 balls.
