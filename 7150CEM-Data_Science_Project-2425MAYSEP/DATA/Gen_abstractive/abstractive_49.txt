Scotland showed that they mean business at this T20 World Cup with Michael Jones and George Munsey forging ahead to 90 without loss in an innings cut in half by heavy rain. But the weather eventually ruined their opening match against defending champions England. An untimely rain squall  followed by a damp spot on the pitch delayed the start by 55 minutes after Scotland had won the toss and opted to bat.
