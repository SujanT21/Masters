Pakistan record their first win of the T20 World Cup beating Canada by seven wickets in New York. The win was set up by the fast bowlers who combined to pick up six wickets to restrict Canada for 106 for 7 in their 20 overs despite an Aaron Johnson 44 ball 52. In reply Pakistan stumbled in the powerplay  and brought in Saim Ayub in place of Iftikhar Ahmed. Ayub walked out to open with Mohammad Rizwan thus splitting theÂ Rizwan Babar Azam partnership up top. Babar fell with victory in sight  but Riz Wan stayed put crafting an unbeaten run a ball 53 to give Pakistan victory 15 balls to spare.
