USA announced their arrival in the T20 World Cup with a demolition of their rivals Canada in Dallas. Aaron Jones and Andries Gous made a mockery of their chase of 195 with a 131 run third wicket partnership at a whirlwind run rate of 14 29. USA got the job done with seven wickets and 14 balls to spare with Jones going on a six hitting spree.
