Australia beat Oman by 39 runs in their T20 World Cup 2024 opener on a tricky Barbados pitch. Glenn Maxwell fell for a golden duck continuing his horror run with the bat. Marcus Stoinis was dropped on 9 and then bludgeoned six sixes as he turned around a sluggish start. Australia were largely efficient with the ball as Mitchell Starc struck in the opening over with an inswinging low full toss.
