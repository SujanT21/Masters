Australia beat Scotland by six wickets to secure their Super Eight berth in the T20 World Cup 2024 in Antigua. Scotland had been outstanding for three quarters of the contest on one of the better batting surfaces of the tournament so far. Australia could not get up or ahead of the asking rate through the first half of the innings. Australia had an uncharacteristically poor day in the field missing six chances in a poor fielding display.
