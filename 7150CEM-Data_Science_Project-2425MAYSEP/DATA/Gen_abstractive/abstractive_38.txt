Australia outplayed England in Barbados to leave the defending champions sweating on their qualification for the Super 8s. They posted the highest score of the T20 World Cup to date after David Warner and Travis Head blitzed 70 runs in the first five overs. Adam Zampa made the difference in England s lacklustre run chase. The result is not terminal for England s title defence but they have one point from their first two matches and face an anxious week ahead.
