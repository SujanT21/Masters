Sri Lanka ended their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign in a resounding fashion with a dominant 83 run win over Netherlands in Gros Islet. It meant they ended on three points and third place in Group D behind South Africa and Bangladesh  who had confirmed their place in the Super Eight after beating Nepal in Kingstown. Sri Lanka s victory set up by their batters and finished off clinically by the bowlers. Nuwan Thushara was the pick of the bunch with figures of 3 for 24  but each of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, Dasun Shanaka and Matheesha Pathirana also got in on the act as Netherlands were knocked out and bowled out 118 in chase of 202.
