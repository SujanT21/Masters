USA muzzled an experienced Pakistan top order  brought their hitters to heel  then produced a measured batting performance that tied the scores at 159 all. This forced the game into a Super Over  and here is when USA really seemed like the veteran team on the circuit while Pakistan went into high pressure meltdown mode. Saurabh Netravalkar had been outstanding for USA in regular play  taking 2 for 18 from his four overs  His Super Over was outstanding too as he conceded just one boundary  Thanks to extras and other acts of fielding indiscipline from Pakistan  USA made 18 off their Super Over.
