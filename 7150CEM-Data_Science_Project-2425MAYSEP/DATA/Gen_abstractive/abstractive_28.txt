Shakib Al Hasan scored his first fifty in 20 T20I innings to shepherd Bangladesh to 159 for 5. Netherlands made a good fist of the chase moving to 111 for 3 in the 15th over. But legspinner Rishad Hossain struck three times in four balls spread across two overs to change the course of the game. Netherlands fell in a heap  losing 4 for 6 in the space of 16 balls. They still had an outside chance with 36 needed off the last two overs but Mustafizur Rahman s cutters proved too much to handle.
