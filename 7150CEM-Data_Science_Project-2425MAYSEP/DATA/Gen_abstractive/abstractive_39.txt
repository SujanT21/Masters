South Africa made heavy weather of a modest chase in New York. David Miller and Tristan Stubbs dug deep to save them from a third straight defeat at Netherlands hands at an ICC tournament. Miller and Stubbs added 65 for the fifth wicket to lift them from 12 for 4 on a pitch that didn't play anywhere as badly as the scorecard suggested.
