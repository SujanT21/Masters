Nuwan Thushara took two wickets in two balls in the next over to bring Sri Lanka back into the contest. Mahmudullah pushed his side across the line off the last ball of the 19th over to give his side victory. Sri Lanka s inability to find boundaries  or even rotate strike against good Bangladesh bowling resulted in their downfall.
