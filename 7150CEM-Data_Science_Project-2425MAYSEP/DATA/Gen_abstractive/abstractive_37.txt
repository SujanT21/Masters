Akeal Hosein scythed through Uganda in a sublime opening spell  plundering five wickets for 11 runs. That spell sent West Indies hurtling to a 134 run victory on a slow Providence deck. Johnson Charles struck 44 off 42 and Andre Russell cracked 30 not out off 17 as West Indies willed their way to 173 for 5.
